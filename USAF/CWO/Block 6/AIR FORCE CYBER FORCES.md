- **1B4X1 Structure**
    
    **What is a Prefix?**
    
    - The purpose of a prefix is to identify an Airman’s additional qualifications and experience. Prefixes are authorized for use with AFSCs when there is a need to identify an ability or skill not restricted to a single utilization field or career field.
    
    **Prefix T**
    
    - The prefix T identifies enlisted Airmen who are serving in, qualified to serve in, or receiving training to qualify to serve in formal training instructor positions.
    
    **Prefix U**
    
    - The prefix U identifies enlisted Airmen who are serving in, qualified to serve in, or receiving formal training to qualify to serve in positions requiring information operations (IO) expertise and knowledge.
    - The planning and employment of military deception (MILDEC), psychological operations, operations security (OPSEC), network warfare operations, or electronic warfare operations.

    - The understanding of ISR, precision navigation and positioning, weather, other information dissemination activities, and conducting information operations (offensive and defensive).
    - Use of prefix U on the unit manning document (UMD) is restricted solely to authorizations in unified commands, HAF, MAJCOM, NAF, C-NAF, air and space operations centers, and initial operations training (IOT) positions
    - The prefix U is affixed to your control AFSC and is affixed when you enter a formal training course leading to an IO assignment. However, if you fail to complete the training, the prefix is withdrawn from the control AFSC.

    **Career Field**
    
    - The combination of the first and second characters in an AFSC identifies the career field; the career field is a functional grouping of personnel requiring the same knowledge and skills.
    
    **Career Field Subdivision**
    
    - The combination of the first through the third characters identifies the career field subdivision; the career field subdivision is a logical grouping of personnel with related work requirements and qualifications.
    
    **Skill Level**
    
    - The fourth character identifies the skill level; with time, training, experience, and rank, your skill level will gradually increase.
    
    **AFSC**
    
    - Lastly, all five alphanumeric characters together specifies an AFSC

- **1B4X1 Progression**
    
    **CFETP**
    
    - The CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for each Air Force specialty.
    
    **Purpose of the CFETP**
    
    - The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training individuals should receive to develop and progress throughout their careers.
    - Upgrade training (UGT) identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, career development course (CDC) completion, and correspondence courses required for awarding the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.
    - Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.
    
    **Use of the CFETP**
    
    - The CFETP is maintained by the 1BXXX AFCFM, secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information Dominance and chief information officer (SAF/CIO A6).
    - Using the list of courses in Part II, they determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate and prevent duplicate efforts.
    - Career field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder.

    ### GS
    
    - The GS is the pay scale for the majority of salaried personnel in the civil service workforce of the United States government. The GS is divided into 15 pay grades (GS-1 to GS-15) and further subdivided into 10 steps (1-10). New GS employees generally enter the first step of their assigned grade; however, as a recruiting incentive, appointments to higher steps may be made.
    
    ### Senior Executive Service (SES)
    
    - Civil service personnel who occupy managerial, supervisory, and policy positions classified above GS-15 or equivalent pay grade in the Executive Branch of the United States Government will enter the Senior Executive Service (SES). Generally, within the DoD, SES personnel are considered analogous to flag and general officers in the U.S. Armed Forces.
    
    ### Contractor related cyberspace fields
    
    - Contracts for services rendered to the DoD (or any government agency) by a private corporation must be supervised by a federal employee, uniformed or civil service. This oversight is provided by a Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).
    - CORs are responsible for ensuring all aspects of the legal contract are fulfilled, as well as working with the contractor to guarantee that their personnel are qualified, pass background checks, and have access to the areas required to perform their duties to fulfill the contract.
