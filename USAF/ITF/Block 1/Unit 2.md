# Unit 2 - Personal and Equipment Protection

**Grounding**

**Main Functions**

1. Personal Safety

2. Equipment Protection

3. Electrical Noise Reduction

**Facility Ground System**

1.**Earth Electrode Subsystem**- provides the connection between the earth and other subsytems

1) Ground rods

2) Metal straps

3) Wires

4) Tubes

5) Grids

6) Plates

7) Sheets

8) Water pipes

9) Well casings

3.

**Equipment Fault Protective Subsystem**

- protects the personnel and equipment from voltages caused by faults in electrical circuits

1) AKA “The Safety Ground”

1) Electrically seperated from the phase and neutral conductors of the power distrobution system

2) Physically seperated from the signal conductors and the signal reference subsystem

3) Installed in the same conduit as other power conductors

3.

**Sigal Reference Subsystem**

- The most common method to establish a multipoint signal reference subsystem is to bond equipment cabinets,racks, conduit, duct, bus bars, wires and other conductors to a common interior metal sheet or grid. (Equipotential plane - since all points in the network are at the same potential)

1) AKA “Signal Ground”

2) The vast majority of signal reference subsystems are multipoint systems

**Bonding**

1. Establish a low-impedance path between two metal surfaces

2. Refers to both mechanical and bonding straps

3. Types

1)

**Permanent Direct**

- contact of the metal mating surfaces

1- Welding, Brazing, Soldering

2)

**Direct semi-permanent**

- bolts, clamps, etc.

1- Contact areas must be clean and protective coating must be removed

3)

**Indirect**

- Bonding wires, Bonding Straps

1- Mechanical bond must be mechanically strong

**Electrostatic Discharge**

1.

**Definition**

- Sudden flow of electricity between any two electrically charged objects

2.**Types of failures**

1) Catastrophic - Total Failure

2) Intermittent - Irregular failure of the components

3) Latent - Delayed failure of the electronic components or circuits

3.**Control Measures**

1) Prevent buildup

2) Workstation and Personnel Grounding

1- Group straps and static dissipative floor mat

3) Handling Precautions

**Physical Security**

1. Security concerned with active and passive measures

2.**Requirements**

- Must be addressed and approved before construction of a facility

1) Type of equipment

2) Level of security

3) Mission of unit

4) Duty hours of security

3.

**Examples**

1) Control area

1- Requires some form of identification to get access

2) Restricted Aarea

1- Requires RAB (Flight line, SCIF, ETC.)

3) No-Lone Zone

1- Personnel required to accompanied by a companion

1> Shred area, burn zone

4.

**Active Measures**

1- Technology

2- Barriers

3- Barbed Wires

4- Metal Detectors

5- Armed Patrol

6- Military Working Dog

5.

**Passive Measures**

1) Architecture

2) Landscaping

3) Lighting to deter, disrupt

4) Hedges

5) Single Point of Entry

**Safety Precautions**

1.

**Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH)**

1) Covered in AF 91-series

2. Communication Electronics work areas outlined in 91-203, Occupational Safety, Fire and Health Standards

3.

**General Safety**

1) No rings

2) No Watches

3) Know location of on/off switches

4.

**Housekeeping**

1) No Food or Beverages

2) Dispose of flammable wastes in clearly marked metal containers

5.

**Tools and Equipment**

1) Nonconductive tools when required,

2) Taping or plastic coatings are not an acceptable method of insulation

3) Keep area clean

6.

**Major Safety Precautions**

1) Do not experiment

2) Avoid working in wet clothing

3) Avoid working alone

4) Use hand whenever possible to minimize current path through chest

7.

**Warning and Caution Statements**

1) Warnings used for personnel

2) Caution used to protect equipment and property

3) Use checklist and technical data when at all possible
