- **Base Level IA Roles and Responsibilities**
    
    **Base level IA roles and responsibilities**
    
    At the base level, roles and responsibilities are generally divided into two separate groups:  Wing level and unit level.  As a study aid to distinguish between the two, roles at the wing level typically have “Manager” in their title, whereas roles at the unit level do not.
    
    **Wing Cybersecurity Office (WCO)**
    
    The Wing Cybersecurity Office (WCO) addresses all cybersecurity requirements on the base for IT under the control of the base communications squadron/flight, including IT of tenant units unless formal agreements exist. Some of the duties of a wing cybersecurity office are as follows:
    
    - Track and manage cybersecurity positions assigned by a commander including system information systems security managers (ISSM) and information systems security officers (ISSO) assigned by program managers (PM), communications security account managers (CAM), communications security responsible officers (CRO), cybersecurity liaisons, privileged users, and secure voice responsible officers (SVRO).
    - Manage the overall COMSEC posture of their installation.
    
    **Wing Information Assurance (IA) Office****
    
    The Wing IA Office is the focal point for managing all IA related issues for a wing.  The Wing IA Office is typically a centralized office where the EMSEC (TEMPEST) Manager, COMSEC Manager, and Information Assurance Manager (IAM) all work.  We will discuss each of these roles in detail below.  Two of the major duties of the Wing IA office is to:
    
    - Track and manage cybersecurity positions assigned by a commander including system information systems security managers (ISSM) and information systems security officers (ISSO) assigned by program managers (PM), communications security account managers (CAM), communications security responsible officers (CRO), cybersecurity liaisons, privileged users, and secure voice responsible officers (SVRO).
    - Manage the overall COMSEC posture of their installation.
    
    **EMSEC (TEMPEST) Manager**
    
    **The EMSEC (TEMPEST) Manger works as part of the Wing IA Office and is responsible for the proper management of all EMSEC (TEMPEST) issues on the base. They play a key role in the process to establish and install new equipment that could potentially lead to compromising emanations (CE).
    
    **Information Assurance Manager (IAM)/Information System Security Manager (ISSM)**
    
    - The Information Assurance Manager (IAM)/Information System Security Manager (ISSM) is responsible for all aspects of COMPUSEC as part of an IA program for a large organization or location (typically referring to a Wing level organization).
    - They will coordinate with organizations under their responsibility to ensure all organizations have Information Assurance Officers (IAOs) appointed and that they have complete all required COMPUSEC and IA training.  Additionally, Information Assurance Manager (IAM)/Information System Security Manager (ISSM) ****ensure users receive training or reminders (on an annual basis) on the security rules of behavior or acceptable use policy for each information system for which they have access.
        - This requirement is above and beyond the initial/refresher Information Protection training provided on the Advanced Distributed Learning System.
    
    **Information Assurance Officer (IAO)****
    
    The IAO is the unit level counterpart to the IAM/ISSM.  As such they act as the single liaison between the organization and IAM/ISSM or wing IA office for COMPUSEC matters under the IA program. A few of their duties are below:
    
    - Develops, implements, oversees, and maintains an organization IA program that identifies IA requirements, personnel, processes,
    - Receives training and certification to DoD baseline requirements at IA Management Level
    - Supervises the organization’s IA
    
    With regards to the Information Technology Equipment Custodian (ITEC) program, formally known as Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), the IAO ensures users operate, maintain, and dispose of information systems properly.  
    
    - In some instances under the SAF/CIO hierarchy, IAOs may be directed by the Air Force Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) to perform vulnerability assessments and/or vulnerability mitigation on hardware/software that they are indirectly responsible for within their unit.
    - If users identify vulnerabilities or an IAO discovers vulnerabilities incidents on information systems they must report these to the IAM to submit up to the AFCERT.
    
    One other duty involves ensuring organizations do not use freeware, shareware, or public domain software unless approved for use. Other duties exist as well but they are all too numerous to list them all in detail here.  What it boils down to is that IAOs manage all aspects of COMPUSEC for a unit.
    
    **COMSEC Manager**
    
    The COMSEC Manager is another member of the IA team that works as a part of the Wing IA Office. This role will have specific duties and responsibilities related to the protection of data in transit and cryptography.
    
    **Inquiry or Investigating Official**
    
    **Investigation officials are appointed in special cases when a COMSEC incident has occurred. Prior to commencing an inquiry or investigation they should consult the installation staff judge advocate.  While assigned as an investigating official their primary duty is to resolve the incident.  They should complete the inquiry or investigation without interruptions for temporary duty, leave, or other duties as quickly as possible.
    
    **Information System Users/COMSEC Users**
    
    - Information system users are the individuals who work as part of the base and perform day to day duties.
    - As part of the EMSEC (TEMPEST) process, information systems users must contact their IAO for assistance when the need to process classified information arises.
    - The IAO will request the wing IA office make an EMSEC (TEMPEST) assessment to identify the need for EMSEC (TEMPEST) and determine required countermeasures at the earliest date possible.
    - The users are responsible for implementing the required countermeasures and request an inspection before operation.
        - Once the inspection has taken place the user is responsible for correcting all deficiencies identified by an EMSEC (TEMPEST) inspection and request a re-inspection.
        - If the user cannot comply with the recommended countermeasures he/she will initiate requests for temporary and permanent waivers and EMSEC (TEMPEST) tests when needed.
    
    **Wing Commanders****
    
    - Examples include issuing policy and guidance to all assigned personnel to ensure OPSEC is integrated in day-to-day and contingency operations.
    - This is usually handled through the appointment of a primary and alternate OPSEC PM.
    - Also, as mentioned before, OPSEC PM is responsible for coming up with the OPSEC Plan. The Commander is responsible for approving that OPSEC Plan and that CIL are developed and enforced by the OPSEC PM.
    
    **Squadron Commander**
    
    - When discussing the concept of COMSEC, the squadron commander ensures a CRO and at least one alternate is appointed in writing to receive COMSEC materials from the COMSEC manager.
    - They must also ensure that adequate approved security containers or facilities are available for storing COMSEC materials and if equipment is no longer needed ensures that a NSA-approved destruction device is readily available.
    - If an investigating official of COMSEC material is necessary then the squadron commander will appoint one.
    - Commanders will also ensure that appropriate equipment custodians are assigned to handle ITEC accounts and annual inventories are completed.
- **OPSEC**
    
    **What is OPSEC?**
    
    - The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of missions by eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information.
    - OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations. The OPSEC program is an operations function or activity.
    - OPSEC’s most important characteristic is that it is a process.
        - This process can be applied to any operation or activity for the purpose of denying critical information to an adversary.
    
    **Critical information**
    
    - OPSEC’s goal is to protect critical information (CI); CI is the specific facts about friendly intentions, capabilities, and activities needed by adversaries to plan and act effectively to disrupt or deny friendly mission accomplishment.
    - An adversary may either obtain CI as a whole or derive CI by linking together seemingly unrelated elements of information that can be collected, interpreted, or pieced together by an adversary to derive and/or exploit.
    
    **OPSEC Concept and Applicability**
    
    - OPSEC is practiced by every organization in the Air Force, especially in the cyber realm.
    
    **The OPSEC Process**
    
    **The OPSEC process consists of five distinct actions**:
    
    1.  Identify critical information
    2. Analyze threats
    3. Analyze vulnerabilities
    4. Access risk
    5. Apply countermeasures 
    
    **1. Identification of Critical Information**
    
    - The development of a critical information list (CIL) is the first step in the OPSEC process.
    - A critical information list should be developed and continuously updated in peacetime as well as during a contingency.
        - Commanders must approve the CIL and ensure their critical information is protected and/or controlled.
        
        **Below is the type of information a CIL can contain:**
        
        1. Operations
        2. Plans
        3. Communications
        4. Intelligence
        5. Logistics
        6. Budget
        7. Personnel
        
    
    **2. Analysis of threats**
    
    Analysis of threats involves the research and analysis of intelligence, CI, and open-source information to identify the likely adversaries to the planned operation.
    
    At minimum, these questions should be answered:
    
    - Who is the adversary?
    - What are the adversary’s goals?
    - What is the adversary’s course of action for opposing the planned operation?
    - What critical information does the adversary already know about the operation?
    - What are the adversary’s intelligence collection capabilities?
    - Who are the affiliates of the adversary, and will they share information?
    
    **3. Analysis of vulnerabilities**
    
    - The purpose analysis of vulnerabilities is to identify an operation’s or activity’s vulnerabilities.
    - It requires examining each aspect of the planned operation to identify any OPSEC indicators or vulnerabilities that could reveal critical information and then comparing those indicators or vulnerabilities with the adversary’s intelligence collection capabilities identified in the previous action.
    - A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information, correctly analyzing it, and then taking timely action.
    - The adversary can then exploit that vulnerability to obtain an advantage.
    
    **4. Assessment of risk**
    
    **Assessment of risk has three components.** 
    
    1. The vulnerabilities identified in the previous action are analyzed and possible OPSEC countermeasures for each vulnerability are identified. 
    2. The commander and staff estimate the impact to operations such as cost in time, resources, personnel or interference with other operations associated with implementing each possible OPSEC countermeasure versus the potential harmful effects on mission accomplishment resulting from an adversary’s exploitation of a particular vulnerability. 
    3. The commander and staff select specific OPSEC countermeasures for execution based upon a risk assessment done by the commander and staff.
    
    **5. Application of appropriate OPSEC countermeasures**
    
    - The commander implements the OPSEC countermeasures selected in the assessment of risk process.
        - This is the last step of the OPSEC process.
    
    **OPSEC Responsibilities**
    
    Although OPSEC is the responsibility of all members of the Air Force; let’s discuss the OPSEC responsibilities of specific key Air Force members.
    
    **SECAF, Office of Information Dominance and Chief Information Officer**
    
    SAF/CIO A6 has the following OPSEC responsibilities:
    
    - Ensure OPSEC principles are included in information assurance policy, guidance, and operational oversight.
    - Ensure OPSEC principles and practices are correctly reflected in the AF enterprise architecture .
    - Ensure OPSEC is incorporated into the developing net-centric operating environments to mitigate the risks of classification through compilation of critical information STQ6.
    
    **OPSEC program managers and coordinators**
    
    - OPSEC PMs are assigned in writing at organizations above the wing/installation level.
    - OPSEC PMs may be assigned to field operating agencies (FOAs) and direct reporting units (DRUs) depending on their size, need, and organizational reporting chain.
    
    OPSEC coordinators are assigned in writing at each subordinate organization below wing-level. At the major command (MAJCOM) level, National Guard Bureau (NGB), FOAs, or DRUs, OPSEC coordinators will be appointed within headquarters directorates, as appropriate.
    
    Here are some of responsibilities of OPSEC PMs and coordinators:
    
    - Advise commander or director on all OPSEC and signature management related matters to include developing operating instructions, recommending guidance, and OPSEC measures.
    - Incorporate OPSEC into organizational plans, exercises, and activities.
    - Develop, implement, and distribute commander’s OPSEC guidance memorandums to include CILs, and follow up with new or updates to local or MAJCOM supplements to AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC).
    - Ensure procedures are in place to control critical information and associated indicators.
    - Provide oversight and management of organization’s OPSEC education and training.
    
    **All Air Force members**
    
    As stated earlier, OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility. Here are some of the responsibilities shared by every AF member:
    
    - Be familiar with your organization’s critical information.
    - Protect critical and/or sensitive information from disclosure. This includes but is not limited to letters, articles, emails, blogs, website postings, message boards, or other forms of dissemination or documentation. When publicly posting or publishing work-related information that potentially contains critical or sensitive information, solicit the advice of immediate supervisor, security office and/or OPSEC PM/coordinator. This aids in preventing disclosure of critical and/or sensitive information.
    - Actively encourage others members to protect critical and/or sensitive information.
    - Destroy (burn, shred, etc.) critical and/or sensitive unclassified information that is no longer needed to prevent the inadvertent disclosure and/or reconstruction of this material.
    - Consider attempts by unauthorized personnel to solicit critical and/or sensitive information as human intelligence (HUMINT) gathering and consider it a HUMINT incident. AF personnel who have been involved in or have knowledge of a possible incident will report all facts immediately to the nearest supporting AFOSI office. If an AFOSI office is not readily available, HUMINT incidents will be reported to the organization’s security manager or commander who will ensure that, without exception, reports are relayed as securely and expeditiously within 24 hours to the nearest AFOSI organization.
    
    **OPSEC Reports**
    
    The Air Force OPSEC program has two types of time-sensitive reports; they are OPSEC vulnerability reports and OPSEC advisory reports.
    
    - OPSEC vulnerability reports - Identify a disclosure of critical information or provide the identification of OPSEC indicators that could jeopardize ongoing or planned operations. This reporting is not intended to assign blame or initiate punitive action, but rather to highlight potential vulnerabilities, identify trends, and improve the Air Force’s OPSEC posture.
    - OPSEC advisory reports- Provide advanced notification of a potential threat to operations. Examples include flight paths of foreign aircraft over US territory, location of foreign naval vessels with collection capabilities, and projected commercial satellite exploitation.
    - OPSEC program managers must review OPSEC reports and ensure commanders and subordinate organizations are informed.
