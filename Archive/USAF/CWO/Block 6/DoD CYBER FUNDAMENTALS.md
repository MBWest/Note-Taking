# UNIT 2: DoD CYBER FUNDAMENTALS

The cyberspace domain is the primary conduit for transactions vital to every facet of modern life

---

- **National Security Strategy (NSS)**
    - The National Security Strategy (NSS) provides the highest level of strategic planning. The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a document the president, along with his Cabinet and support staff, prepares and submits to Congress that outlines the major national security concerns of the United States and how the administration plans to deal with them.
    - Cyberspace professional include positions that are focused specifically on cyberspace missions: establishing, controlling and/or leveraging cyberspace capabilities within the DoD and selected government positions
- **National Defense Strategy (NDS)**
    - The National Defense Strategy (NDS) is developed by the DOD and signed by the SecDef. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) supports the National Security Strategy (NSS) by establishing a set of overarching defense objectives that guide the DOD’s security activities and provide direction for the National Military Strategy (NMS).
    - The National Defense Strategy (NDS) supports the National Security Strategy (NSS) and provides the framework on which the United States will achieve enduring security.
    
    ### DOD has five key objectives as outlined in the NDS
    
    1. Defend the Homeland
    2. Win the long war
    3. Promote Security
    4. Deter conflict
    5. win our nation's wars
    
    The National Defense Strategy (NDS) is classified and is issued periodically; the last one was published in January 2018. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) builds on lessons learned and insights from from previous operations and strategic reviews.
    
- **National Military Strategy (NMS)**
    - The National Military Strategy (NMS) was last published in June 2015.
    - The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), in consultation with the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the commanders of the unified combatant commands (CCMD), the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), prepares the National Military Strategy (NMS) and delivers it to the SecDef.
    - The National Military Strategy (NMS) briefly outlines the strategic aims of the armed services by supporting the National Security Strategy (NSS) and implementing the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The National Military Strategy's (NMS) chief source of guidance is the National Security Strategy (NSS).
    
    **The NMS describes ways and means to achieve the military objectives and establishes three military objectives that support the NDS:**
    
    1. Protect the Unites States against external attacks and aggression.
    
    2. Prevent conflict and surprise attack.
    
    3. Prevail against adversaries.
    
- **Cyberspace Policy, Doctrine, and Guidance**
    - Prior to the 43rd presidential administration, no solid guidance existed. Only in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the standup of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the identification of critical infrastructures, did cyberspace become a high priority political interest item.
    
    ### National Cyberspace Policy and Cyberspace Strategy
    
    **National Cyberspace Policy**
    
    - It is the policy of the United States to prevent or minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructures and, thereby, protect the people, economy, essential human and government services, and national security of the United States.
    
    **Military cyberspace operations strategy**
    
    - The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO) is the US Armed Forces’ comprehensive strategic approach for using cyberspace operations to assure US military strategic superiority in the domain.
    - Cyberspace operations doctrine and guidance exist at the joint level and many other major levels in the military.
    
    ### Air Force Guidance
    
    **Joint Publication 3–12, Cyberspace Operations**
    
    - Joint Publication (JP) 3–12, Cyberspace Operations, was prepared under the direction of the CJCS.
    - The purpose of this document is to set forth joint doctrine to govern the activities and performance of the military in joint cyberspace operations and provide considerations for military interaction with governmental and nongovernmental agencies, multinational forces, and other inter-organizational partners.
    
    **Air Force Policy Directive 17–2, Cyberspace Operations**
    
    - Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 17–2, Cyberspace Operations, establishes Air Force policy for planning and executing Air Force and joint cyberspace operations.
    - It also states the cyberspace operations related responsibilities of MAJCOMs, direct reporting units (DRU), field operating agencies (FOA), and other important people involved in executing operations to achieve Information Dominance in cyberspace.
    
    **Air Force Doctrine Document 3–12, Cyberspace Operations**
    
    - Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 3–12, Cyberspace Operations, is the Air Force’s foundational doctrine publication for Air Force operations in, through, and from the cyberspace domain.
    - It discusses many cyberspace related topics ranging from cyberspace threats, C2 of cyberspace forces, planning and executing cyberspace operations, and many other cyberspace related topics.
- **Command Structure**
    
    **The levels of authority we will cover are:**
    
    1. Support
    2. Combatant Command (command authority)
    3. Operational Control (OPCON)
    4. Administrative Control (ADCON)
    5. Tactical Control (TACON)
    
    ### Support
    
    - Support is a command authority established by a common superior commander between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force.
    - The SecDef establishes support relationships between the Combatant Commanders (CCDR) for the planning and execution of joint operations.
    - The establishing authority (the common JFC) is responsible for ensuring that both the supported commander and supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is granted.
    - The supporting commander determines the forces, tactics, methods, procedures, and communications to be employed in providing this support.
    - The supporting commander advises and coordinates with the supported commander on matters concerning the employment and limitations of such support and assists in planning for the integration of such support into the supported commander’s effort as a whole
    
    ### Combatant Command (COCOM)
    
    - Combatant Command (command authority), is the command authority over assigned forces vested only in CCDRs by Title 10 of the U.S.C. or as directed by the president in the Unified Command Plan (UCP).
    - This authority cannot be delegated or transferred as set forth in the National Security Act of 1947.
    - Normally, this authority is exercised through subordinate Joint Force Commanders (JFC) and service and/or functional component commanders (FCC).
    
    ### Operational Control (OPCON)
    
    - Operational Control (OPCON) is a transferable command authority, inherent in COCOM, to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish the mission.
    - Service component commanders and commanders of subordinate commands, including joint task forces (JTF), normally are given OPCON of assigned or attached forces by the superior commander.
    
    ### Tactical Control (TACON)
    
    - Tactical Control (TACON) is a transferable command authority, inherent in Operational Control (OPCON), over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking.
    - Authority is limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks.
    - Tactical Control (TACON) provides the authority to give direction for military operations and to control designated forces (e.g., ground forces, aircraft sorties, missile launches, or satellite payload management).
    
    ### Administrative Control (ADCON)
    
    - Administrative Control (ADCON) is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support including organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
- **Cyber Mission Force**
    
    ### **DODIN (Global Information Grid)**
    
    **The DOD has three cyberspace mission areas:**
    
    1. Secure, operate, and defend the DODIN
    2. Defend the nation against cyberspace attack
    3. Provide CCMD support
    
    ### DODIN Defined
    
    - The DODIN is just a new name for the global information grid. This renaming took place in 2013.
    - The DODIN is the globally interconnected, end-to-end set of information capabilities; associated processes; and personnel for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel.
    - The DODIN includes all owned and leased communications and computing systems and services, software (including applications), data, security services, and other associated services necessary to achieve information superiority.
    - The DODIN supports the DOD, national security, and related IC missions and functions (strategic, operational, tactical, and business), during wartime and peacetime.
    - The DODIN provides capabilities from all operating locations (bases, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile platforms, and deployed sites).
    - Additionally, the DODIN provides interfaces to coalition, allied, and non-DOD users and systems.
    
    ### Reason for the Cyber Mission Force (CMF)
    
    **In 2012, the military services were ordered to build collectively a cyberspace force to carry out DOD’s three cyberspace mission areas:**
    
    1. Secure, operate, and defend the DODIN.
    2. Defend the nation against cyberspace attack.
    3. Provide CCMD support.
    
    **The Cyber Mission Force (CMF) carries out these three mission areas through three lines of operations:** 
    
    1. DODIN operations
    2. DCO
    3. OCO
    
    **Visual of the mission areas supported and lines of operations for the CMF:**
    
    ![UNIT%202%20DoD%209db85/Untitled.png](UNIT%202%20DoD%209db85/Untitled.png)
    
    ### The Cyber Mission Force (CMF) Construct
    
    - The services began building the CMF in early 2013. On 21 October 2016, all CMF teams achieved initial operating capability (IOC).
        - IOC is an assessment of capability, and being IOC means that the CMF teams can execute their fundamental missions.
    - There are now 133 teams aligned to carry out the three cyberspace mission areas of the DOD.
    - The cyberspace protection force will focus on defending the DODIN and other critical mission systems when tasked. The combat mission force will focus on supporting military operations and contingency plans (CCMD support).
    - The national mission force will focus on defending the nation.
    - Lastly, the cyberspace support force will provide support to the national mission teams (NMT) and CMTs.
    
    ### The Cyber Mission Force Command and Control (CMF C2)
    
    - Each subordinate command was created to accomplish one of the cyberspace mission areas at the operational and tactical levels.
    - The Cyber National Mission Force Headquarters (CNMF-HQ) was established and aligned to defend the nation against cyberspace attacks.
    - The Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C) was established and aligned to Combatant Commander (CCMD) support area.
    - The Joint Force Headquarters-DODIN (JFHQ-DODIN) was established and aligned to the secure, operate, and defend the DODIN cyberspace mission area.
    
    **See the figure below for a relationship and C2 breakdown of the CMF:**
    
    ![UNIT%202%20DoD%209db85/Untitled%201.png](UNIT%202%20DoD%209db85/Untitled%201.png)
    
    ### Cyber National Mission Force Headquarters (CNMF-HQ)
    
    The Cyber National Mission Force Headquarters (CNMF-HQ) mission is to direct and synchronize full spectrum cyberspace operations to, on order, deter, disrupt, and if necessary, defeat adversary cyberspace actors in order to defend the DODIN, US critical infrastructure/key resources, and the nation.
    
    **The commander of Cyber National Mission Force Headquarters (CNMF-HQ) has the following responsibilities:**
    
    - Exercise Operational Control (OPCON) for the National Mission Teams (NMT), National Support Teams (NST), and national Cyberspace Protection Teams (CPT) to accomplish assigned mission.
    - Conduct joint tactical planning in support of Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) missions and direct tactical operations from planning through execution.
    - Synchronize Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) maneuver, fires, and effects in support of assigned mission and conduct mission deconfliction with Joint Task Force (JTF) headquarters and other organizations.
    - Synchronize Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) intelligence operations, including intelligence oversight and the collection, production, and dissemination of intelligence in support of cyberspace ISR with appropriate agencies.
    - Coordinate Cyber National Mission Force Headquarters (CNMF-HQ) support functions (personnel, logistics, facility requirements, budget) with USCYBERCOM, NSA, service, and functional components; direct Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) training, exercises, and readiness requirements.
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C)
    
    **JFHQ-C comprises the four distinct services cyberspace headquarters:** 
    
    1. ARCYBER
    2. FLTCYBER
    3. MARFORCYBER
    4. AFCYBER. 
    5. Additionally, although under DHS, the CGCYBER commander is included in JFHQ-C. 
    - Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C) supports the geographic and functional Combat Commander (CCMD) across the globe.
    - Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C) executes Operational Control (OPCON) over the Cyber Mission Teams (CMT) and Cyber Support Team (CST), which are aligned to specific target sets within their respective Commanders (CCMDs).
    - Not just one service component cyberspace headquarters contributes to USCYBERCOM missions; each service component fulfills service-specific requirements in cyberspace, which are correlated with and unique to the individual service’s role in the domain of land, sea, air, and space.
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber ARCYBER (ARMY)
    
    **JFHQ-C ARCYBER’s three priorities are**
    
    1. Operationalize cyberspace operations to support combatant and Army commands at each echelon
    2. Pursue a more defensible network
    3. Organize, man, train, and equip ready cyberspace forces
    
    ARCYBER supports United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber **FLTCYBER (NAVY)**
    
    - JFHQ-C FLTCYBER’s missions align to those of USCYBERCOM.
    - They are to operate Navy networks as a warfighting platform, produce signals intelligence, deliver warfighting effects through cyberspace, create shared cyberspace situational awareness, and establish and mature the Navy’s Cyber Mission Force (CMF).
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber **MARFORCYBER (MARINE)**
    
    - JFHQ-C MARFORCYBER is shaping the tools, doctrine, processes, and capabilities to ensure Marine cyber teams provide effective support to USCYBERCOM and the joint force, while also ensuring Marine air ground task forces achieve victory on the modern battlefield.
    - JFHQ-C MARFORCYBER supports United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber CGCYBER (COAST GUARD)
    
    **The CGCYBER focuses on three strategic priorities in the cyberspace domain:** 
    
    1. Defending cyberspace
    2. Enabling operations
    3. Protecting infrastructure
    
    CGCYBER ensures the security and resiliency of the Coast Guard’s information technology systems and networks to ensure the full scope of the Coast Guard’s capabilities.
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-Cyber **AFCYBER (AIR FORCE)**
    
    Our JFHQ-C AFCYBER supports United States European Command (USEUCOM), USSTRATCOM, and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).
    
    ### Joint Force Headquarters-DODIN (**JFHQ-DODIN)**
    
    JFHQ-DODIN provides unity of command and unity of effort to secure, operate, and defend the DODIN.
    
    - In November 2014, the SecDef approved the establishment of JFHQ-DODIN.
    - The SecDef further directed that the CDRUSSTRATCOM have directive authority for cyberspace operations over all DOD agencies; this directive authority was delegated to the commander of JFHQ-DODIN.
    - The JFHQ-DODIN operates as a C2 headquarters in line with joint doctrine.
        - However, based on the scope, scale, and complexity of the DODIN, the JFHQ-DODIN employs an operational-level C2 approach.
        - This approach acknowledges that no single headquarters can effectively exercise C2 across the full scope of the DODIN operations and defense mission areas.
    
    ### **National Mission Force**
    
    **The national mission force mission**
    
    - The national mission force aligns with DOD’s second cyberspace mission area, which is to defend the US and its interests against cyberspace attacks of significant consequence.
    - The national mission force plans, directs, and synchronized full-spectrum cyberspace operations to be prepared to defend the US homeland and vital interests from disruptive or destructive cyberspace attacks of significant consequence.
    
    **National mission force teams**
    
    - The national mission force is made up of NMTs, national support teams, and national cyberspace protection teams.
        - There are 13 NMTs in the CMF.
    - These professionals conduct planned operations to meet mission needs for a specific problem set and rapidly evaluate, decide, and act in response to unexpected and dynamic situations in cyberspace.
    
    **Command and control**
    
    CNMF-HQ is the subordinate command that has operational control (OPCON) over national support teams (NSTs) and national cyber protection teams (CPTs) unless operating directly under NSA authorities.
    
    ### Combat Mission Force
    
    - The combat mission force’s mission aligns with DOD’s third cyberspace mission area, which is CCMD support.
    - The combat mission force provides integrated cyberspace capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans.
    - Combat mission teams (CMT) and CSTs make up the combat mission force.
        - There are 27 CMTs in the combat mission force.
        - CMTs are tactical units constituted and designated by the USCYBERCOM commander.
    
    ### Cyberspace Protection Force
    
    The cyberspace protection force has the largest slice of the CMF pie with 68 CPTs, or Cyber Protection Teams. 
    
    **Cyberspace Protection Force’s Mission**
    
    - The real-time DCO is a core capability of every CPT in the cyberspace protect force.
    - The CPT’s mission is to enable a supported commander’s mission capabilities and supporting infrastructure by conducting survey, secure, and protect missions to prepare local cyberspace defenders to sustain an advanced cyberspace defense posture and to defend the supported commander’s critical assets and Cyberspace Key Terrain (C-KT).
    
    ### **CPT Authorities/ROE/C2**
    
    **CPT Authorities**
    
    - Authorities to conduct cyberspace defense activities are negotiated by the supported command, supporting command, and the authorizing official (formerly the designated approving authority (DAA)) on a per mission basis appropriate for the CPT’s mission.
    - The SecDef authorizes USCYBERCOM/CC Directive Authority for Cyberspace Operations (DACO)
    
    **CPT Rules of Engagement (ROE)**
    
    - CPTs, in their role of executing DCO-IDMs, are routinely governed by the standing ROE authority and responsibility of commanders to protect their force, including cyberspace assets.
    - Other ROEs for a CPT are arranged and defined by the supported and supporting commander on a per mission basis and updated by leadership during execution.
    - The CPT must not assume the responsibility for generating defensive effects from local cyberspace defenders.
    
    **CPT C2 and Mission Areas**
    
    - All CPT operations are coordinated, conducted, and synchronized with appropriate network owners and the operational commander.
    - The basic structure and capabilities of the CPTs are standardized to enable them to operate interchangeably throughout the DODIN.
        
        **There are four mission areas for CPT operations:** 
        
        1. Service (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) CPTs
        2. CCMD CPTs
        3. DODIN CPTs
        4. National CPTs.
    
    **Cyber Warfare Operations**
    
    **For COs to be successful, the three primary lines of operations (LOO) need to be integrated and employed in a synchronized fashion. The three LOOs are similar to what was discussed earlier in this unit:**
    
    1. Secure, operate, and defend the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) through DODIN operations.
    
    2. Defend the nation from attack in cyberspace through defensive cyberspace operations (DCO).
    
    3. Provide combatant command support through offensive cyberspace operations (OCO).
    
- **Mission Areas**
    
    **Defend the nation against cyberspace attack**
    
    - The first cyberspace mission area is defending the United States and its interests against cyberspace attacks of significant consequence.
    - The purpose of this defensive measure is to blunt an attack and prevent the destruction of property or the loss of life.
    - As a matter of principle, the United States will seek to exhaust all network defense and law enforcement options to mitigate any potential cyberspace risk to the US homeland or US interests before conducting a cyberspace operation.
    
    **The US government has a limited and specific role to play in defending the nation against cyberspace attacks.** 
    
    - The private sector owns and operates over 90 percent of all the networks and infrastructure of cyberspace and is, thus, the first line of defense.
    - While the US government must prepare to defend the country against the most dangerous attacks, most intrusions can be stopped through relatively basic cybersecurity investments that companies can and must make themselves.
    
    **Secure, operate, and defend the DODIN**
    
    - The second DOD cyberspace mission area is to secure, operate, and defend the DODIN.
    - The US military’s dependence on cyberspace for its operations led the SecDef in 2011 to declare cyberspace as an operational domain for purposes of organizing, training, and equipping US military forces.
    - When DOD detects indications of hostile activity within its networks, DOD has quick-response capabilities to close or mitigate vulnerabilities and secure its networks and systems.
    - Network defense operations on DOD networks constitute the vast majority of DOD’s operations in cyberspace.
    
    **Provide CCMD Support**
    
    - The third cyberspace mission area is providing integrated cyberspace capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans. In other words, this is CCMD support.
    - OCOs are cyberspace operations intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.
        - OCOs are authorized like offensive operations in the physical domains via execute orders.
- **Cyber Protection Teams**
    
    **Cyber Protection Team (CPT) Squads**
    
    **A CPT is comprised of a:**
    
    1. Staff element
    2. Five distinct but interdependent squads
        1. Cyberspace support squad
        2. Mission protection squad
        3. Cyber threat emulation squad
        4. Discovery and counter infiltration squad
        5. Cyber readiness squad
    3. if needed, an all-source intelligence analyst
    - Each squad executes a specific cyberspace effect that when combined with the other, enables the completion of a CPT mission
    
    **Cyberspace support squad**
    
    - The primary mission of the cyberspace support squad is to aid in correcting security at the physical network, logical network, and cyber persona layers of cyberspace;
        - the intended end state is an improved and self-sustaining security posture.
    
    **Mission protection squad**
    
    - The mission protection (MP) squad analyzes the supported commander’s identified cyberspace dependencies, essential and critical assets, and C-KT.
    - This squad also conducts mission impact analysis to evaluate risk and develops recommendations for managing risk for mission assurance using CPT artifacts and collaborative team inputs.
    - The MP squad serves as the CPT’s central link to build and sustain the CPT’s understanding and awareness of the supported commander’s mission; the mission protection squad provides the common operational picture of the mission to the staff element.
    
    **Cyber threat emulation squad**
    
    - The cyber threat emulation (CTE) squad provides the means to assess an organization’s security posture with a focus on non-permissive network/information system access.
    - This squad is the CPT’s lead for the analysis and emulation of threats within cyberspace.
    - The CTE squad engages the supported commander’s organic and CPT-employed defenses by emulating specific TTPs used by a known adversary to identify unmitigated vulnerabilities through simulated exploitation or attacks on DOD cyberspace resources.
    
    **Discovery and counter infiltration squad**
    
    - The discover and counter infiltration (DCI) squad detects, illuminates, and defeats previously unknown adversary activity within a specified area of operations (AO).
    - Personnel are trained to detect, discover, and characterize advanced adversary tradecraft within friendly networks that evade routine security measures.
    - The DCI squad seeks to categorize threats and pass them to local cyberspace defenders for action; this procedure frees DCI squad’s processing time for the deeper analysis needed to illuminate advanced and often stealthy threats within cyberspace.
    - The DCI squad monitors networks for unusual activity that may indicate adversary presence and provides real-time protection for critical systems during specific phases of the supported commander’s mission. In contrast to the MP squad, the DCI squad identifies and responds to adversary presence already in friendly cyberspace vice seeking to prevent or deter that presence through enhanced defenses.
    
    **Cyber readiness squad**
    
    - The cyber readiness squad focuses on providing in-depth reviews of mission-supporting cyberspace assets based on DOD policies, regulations, and best practices.
    - Through targeted evaluations, the squad reviews the effectiveness of the current cybersecurity program, information security plan, and security policies; recommend or direct changes; and provide insight into the evaluated organization’s readiness.
    
    **All-source intelligence analyst (if needed)**
    
    - CPTs may integrate an intelligence analyst within each squad.
    - The purpose is to support the development of information flow between the intelligence and operational communities and to support the development of each squad’s area of specialization.
    
    ### CPT Leadership
    
    **CPT Staff Element**
    
    **Each CPT has four leadership positions:** 
    
    1. Team leader
    2. Operations officer
    3. Noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC)
    4. Cyberspace operations planner
    
    **Team leader**
    
    - The CPT team leader has direct responsibility for the execution of the team’s mission.
    - The team leader is the primary advocate for the CPT’s capabilities; the team leader identifies requirements to improve assurance and effectiveness and educates senior leadership about the CPT’s capabilities to support vital decisions for the protection of DOD cyberspace.
    - The team leader oversees mission planning and serves as the lead coordination point with the higher headquarters, supported commander, local cyberspace defenders, adjacent units, and other DOD defensive cyberspace forces at the senior leadership level.
    - The team leader establishes and oversees the integration and coordination of the CPT’s capabilities with the supported commander and local cyberspace defenders.
    - The team leader acts as the central voice of the team and facilitates coordination and actions with the supported commander and local cyberspace defenders.
    
    **Operations officer**
    
    - The operations officer is the keystone to the successful conduct of the team’s mission.
    - This member works with the team leader and cyberspace operations planner to support senior leadership’s requests for effects and properly plans tasks to support these objectives.
    - The operations officer serves as the central position for coordination between all squad leaders to synchronize their effects in support of the team’s objectives.
    - The operations officer directly controls the conduct, timing, and tempo of the team’s mission execution, as guided by the team leader’s direction.
    - The operations officer provides the critical operational link between other CPTs, other defensive cyberspace forces, and the supported commander for coordination and synchronization of operations.
    
    **NCOIC**
    
    - The NCOIC directly supports the team’s objective and direction, as outlined by the team leader and overall management of team personnel.
    - The NCOIC manages the overall health and safety of the team and its individuals.
    - The NCOIC advises the team leader and operations officer on personnel needs and training issues, technical capability development, and readiness.
    - The NCOIC supports the leadership team as required.
    
    **Cyberspace operations planner**
    
    - The cyberspace operations planner coordinates with senior leadership, the support commander, and local cyberspace defenders, to build a feasible, suitable, and acceptable plan of action to support the required mission objectives.
    - The planner works closely with the team leader and operations officer to ensure the team is best prepared and aligned to meet the mission objectives and that foundational information is collected, coordinated, and approved prior to hand-off for execution.
- **Cyber Warfare Operations**
    
    **Cyber Warfare Operations**
    
    **The three Lines of Operations (LOO)s are similar to what was discussed earlier in this unit:**
    
    1. Secure, operate, and defend the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) through DODIN operations.
    
    2. Defend the nation from attack in cyberspace through defensive cyberspace operations (DCO).
    
    3. Provide combatant command support through offensive cyberspace operations (OCO).
    
    **What is cyberspace?**
    
    - Cyberspace, while part of the information environment, is one of the five interdependent domains.
    - Cyberspace comprises the Internet, networks, systems, associated peripherals, and users in the information environment.
    
    **Cyberspace’s Unique Characteristics**
    
    ***Cyberspace can be reverse engineered***
    
    - As cyberspace operators, we must account for the possibility of a “cyber ricochet” by which cyberspace activities are turned against us or other unintended targets through reverse engineering.
    
    ***Cyberspace has no single national/international ownership***
    
    - Its infrastructure is a disparate combination of public and private networks without standardized security or access controls.
    - While this arrangement enables free information flow, the lack of controls hinders global accountability, standardization, and security.
    
    ***Cyberspace lacks cooperation/collaboration***
    
    - The lack of international laws and regulations governing the environment complicates responses to actions in this domain.
    - The difficulty in tracing the source of a cyberspace attack makes them easily deniable, especially if conducted by individual “hackers.”
    
    ***Cyberspace is low cost***
    
    - Cyberspace is the most affordable domain through which to attack almost any nation including the United States.
    - Inexpensive tools and training allow an adversary to compete without needing equipment such as ships, aircraft, or missiles.
    
    ***Cyberspace is volatile***
    
    - Successful cyberspace attacks depend on vulnerabilities within the adversary’s network.
    - Identifying these vulnerabilities and creating cyberspace defense capabilities sometimes requires a large financial investment.
    - If a targeted nation or other entity discovers its network’s vulnerability and closes it, the cyberspace attack technique is rendered immediately and unexpectedly useless despite the expense and programming effort that went into its development.
    
    ***Cyberspace has unintentional cascading effects***
    
    - Another unique characteristic of cyberspace is the potential for unintended cascading effects.
    - Capabilities and munitions in the natural domains lose momentum the greater distance from impact.
    
    **Cyberspace’s Three Layers**
    
    **Physical network layer**
    
    - The physical network layer is the actual network components located in the physical domains where information technology (IT) infrastructure resides and where data travels, including data repositories and the connections between network components that transfer data.
    - The physical network components include the hardware and infrastructure (e.g., computing devices, storage devices, routers, and wired and wireless links).
    - Components of the physical network layer require physical security measures to protect them from physical damage or unauthorized physical access.
    - Physical access can sometimes be leveraged to gain other access.
    - It is also the primary layer for geospatial intelligence that can contribute to targeting data in cyberspace.
    - The physical network layer is a primary target for exploitation, including signals intelligence, measurement and signature intelligence, open-source intelligence, and human intelligence.
    - The physical network layer is the first point of reference for determining jurisdiction and application of authorities.
    - Therefore, unlike the physical domains, cyberspace has no portions of the OE where US forces can freely maneuver without consideration of sovereignty.
    
    **Logical network layer**
    
    - The logical network layer consists of those elements of the network related to one another in a way that is abstracted from the physical network.
    - It is based on the logic programming (code) that drives network components.
    - Individual links and nodes are represented in the logical layer, but so are various distributed elements of cyberspace, including data, applications, and network processes not tied to a single node.
        - An example is the Joint Knowledge Online Web site, which exists on multiple servers in multiple locations in the physical domains, but is represented as a single uniform resource locator on the Web.
        - More complex examples of the logical layer are the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), which are global, multi-segment networks that can be thought of as a single network only in the logical sense.
    
    **Cyber persona layer**
    
    - The cyber persona layer is a view of cyberspace created by abstracting data from the logical network layer using logical network layer rules to develop descriptions of cyber personas, which are digital representations of an actor or entity identity in cyberspace.
    - The cyber persona layer consists of network or IT users, whether human or automated, and their relationships to one another.
        - Cyber personas may relate directly to an actual person or entity, incorporating some personal or organizational data, (e.g., e-mail and IP addresses, Web pages, phone numbers, Web forum log-ins, or financial account passwords).
    - One individual may create and maintain multiple cyber personas through use of multiple identifiers in cyberspace—such as separate work and personal e-mail addresses, and different identities on different Web forums, chat rooms, and social networking sites—that may vary in the degree to which they are factually accurate.
    - Conversely, a single cyber persona can have multiple users, such as multiple hackers using the same malware control infrastructure, multiple extremists using a single bank account, or all members of the same organization using the same e-mail address.
    - The use of cyber personas can make attribution difficult. Because cyber personas can be complex with elements in many virtual locations not linked to a single physical location or form, identifying them requires significant collection and analysis efforts to provide enough insight and situational awareness to enable effective identification, targeting, or other uses.
    
    **Cyberspace’s Lines of Operations**
    
    Cyberspace Operations (COs) are conducted through three LOOs: 
    
    1. DODIN operations
        1. DODIN operations provide mission assurance for DOD operations and defend the DOD information environment.
    2. DCOs
        1. DCOs deter or defeat strategic threats to national interests and critical infrastructure.
    3. OCOs 
        1. OCOs support joint force commander objectives globally. Let’s discuss DODIN operations first as they enable all Cyberspace Operations (COs).
    
    **Department of Defense Information Network Operations**
    
    - The DODIN operations mission includes operational actions taken to secure, configure, operate, extend, maintain, and sustain DOD cyberspace to create and preserve the security of the DODIN.
    - These include proactive cyberspace security actions that address DODIN vulnerabilities or specific segments of the DODIN.
    - It also includes the setup of tactical networks by deployed forces to extend existing networks, maintenance actions, and other non-security actions necessary for sustaining the DODIN, and the operation of red teams and other forms of security evaluation and testing.
    - DODIN operations are network-focused and threat-agnostic and the cyberspace forces and workforce undertaking this mission endeavor to keep all threats out of the particular network or system they are assigned to protect.
    - They are threat-informed and use all available intelligence about specific threats to improve the security posture of the network.
    - DODIN operations do not include actions taken under statutory authority to provision cyberspace for operations, including IT architecture development; establishing standards; or designing, building, or otherwise operationalizing DODIN IT for use by a commander.
    - DODIN operations are a standing mission and, although many DODIN operations activities are regularly scheduled events, they cannot be considered routine since their aggregate effect establishes the security framework that most DOD missions ultimately depend on.
    
    **Defensive cyberspace operations**
    
    - DCO missions are executed to defend the DODIN or other cyberspace that DOD cyberspace forces have been ordered to defend from active threats in cyberspace.
    - Specifically, these are passive and active defense missions intended to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, cyberspace-enabled devices, and other designated systems by defeating on-going or imminent malicious cyberspace activity.
    - This distinguishes DCO missions which defeat specific threats that have bypassed, breached, or are threatening to breach security measures, from DODIN operations, which endeavor to secure DOD cyberspace from all threats in advance of any specific threat penetration.
    - DCO missions are conducted in response to threats of attack, exploitation, or other effects of malicious cyberspace activity and leverage information from maneuver, intelligence collection, counterintelligence, law enforcement, and other sources as required.
    - DCO include outmaneuvering or interdicting adversaries taking or about to take actions against defended cyberspace elements or otherwise responding to imminent internal and external cyberspace threats.
    - The goal of DCOs is to defeat the threat of a specific adversary and/or to return a compromised network to a secure and fully functional state.
    
    **Offensive cyberspace operations**
    
    - OCOs are COs intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.
    - OCOs are authorized like offensive operations in the physical domains—via an execute order.
        - Like DCO-RA missions, some OCO missions may include actions that rise to the level of use of force, with physical damage or destruction of systems.
- **Information Operations**
    - Nation states and non-state adversaries are equally aware of the significance of this new technology and will use information-related capabilities to gain advantages in the information environment, just as they would use more traditional military technologies to gain advantages in other operational environments.
    
    **What are Information Operations?**
    
    **According to JP 3–13, *Information Operations*, Information Operations (IOs)** **are defined as follows:**
    
    - The integrated employment, during military operations, of information-related capabilities (IRC) in concert with other LOO to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own.
    
    **Purpose of Information Operations (IOs)**
    
    - The purpose of IOs are to affect adversary and potential adversary decision making with the intent to ultimately affect their behavior in ways that help achieve friendly objectives.
    - Deliberate targeting of an adversary’s decision-making process is enabled by understanding the cognitive factors related to that process, the information that they use, and how they receive and send information.
    - IOs are an integrating function, which means they incorporate capabilities to plan, execute, and assess the information used by adversary decision makers with the intent of influencing, disrupting, corrupting, or usurping that process.
        - This is not the same as integrating non-lethal capabilities and activities that may or may not have a behavior-related objective as their primary purpose.
    - Information Operations (IOs) are fundamental to the overall military objective of influencing an adversary and remain a key enabler for joint force operations. One of the priorities of the joint force commander in any conflict should be achieving decision superiority over the enemy. This entails gaining and maintaining information superiority as well as controlling the information environment. Much of this can be accomplished through Information Operations (IO) capabilities within the cyberspace domain.
    - The information environment, as it relates to Information Operations (IO), is the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information.
        
        **This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions that continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems.** **These dimensions are known as the:**
        
        1. Physical
        2. Informational
        3. Cognitive dimensions
        
    
    **The 3 Dimensions of Information Operations (IO)**
    
    ***The Physical Dimension***
    
    - The physical dimension is composed of command and control systems, key decision makers, and supporting infrastructure that enable individuals and organizations to create effects.
    - The physical dimension includes, but is not limited to, people, command and control facilities, newspapers, books, microwave towers, laptops, smart phones, computers, or any other objects that are subject to empirical measurement.
    - The physical dimension is not confined solely to military or even nation-based systems and processes; it is a defused network connected across national, economic, and geographical boundaries.
    
    ***The Information Dimension***
    
    - The information dimension specifies where and how information is collected, processed, stored, disseminated, and protected.
    - It is the dimension where the command and control of military forces is exercised and where the commander’s intent is conveyed.
    
    ***The Cognitive Dimension***
    
    - The cognitive dimension encompasses the minds of those who transmit, receive, and respond to or act on information.
    - It refers to information processing, perception, judgment, and decision making by individuals or groups.
        - These elements are influenced by many factors including individual and cultural beliefs, norms, vulnerabilities, motivations, emotions, experiences, morals, education, mental health, identities, and ideologies.
    - As such, this dimension constitutes the most important component of the information environment.
