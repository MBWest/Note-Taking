# UNIT 5: CYBER LAW AND ETHICS

- **United States Code**
    
    **What is U.S.C?**
    
    - U.S.C. is a consolidation of general and permanent laws of the United States arranged by subject matter.
    - The U.S.C. is broken down starting with titles, which are very general.
        - Titles are then broken down into subtitles;
            - subtitles are broken into parts;
                - parts are broken into chapters;
                    - chapters are broken into subchapters;
                        - and lastly, subchapters are broken into sections.
    
    **Title 10 - Armed Forces**
    
    - The key focus of Title 10 is national defense through the DOD. Title 10 is broken down into five subtitles.
    - These subtitles can also be considered Title 10’s major subjects.
        - Subtitle A is about General Military Law,
        - Subtitle B is about the Army,
        - Subtitle C is about the Navy and Marine Corps,
        - Subtitle D is about Air Force, and
        - Subtitle E is about the Reserve Components.
    
    Title 10, as it relates to cyber, outlines how the DOD provides manning, training, and equipment for US forces for military operations.
    
    - Subtitle A – General Military Law covers every aspect of the DOD. This subtitle is further broken down by parts, chapters, and sections. U.S.C. 113 covers duties, responsibilities, and the roles of the secretary of defense (SecDef) as this person is the head of the DOD. As the head, the SecDef has the overall responsibility of military operations in cyberspace.
    - Subtitle B – Army, Subtitle C – Navy and Marine Corps, Subtitle D – Air Force all have matching titles for Part I and Part II. Part I is titled Organization; some of the topics covered are each Military Service’s purpose, composition, and policies and responsibilities of each Military Service’s civilian and military leadership.
        - Part II is titled Personnel; some of the topics covered are each Military Service’s personnel strength, retirement pay, and awards and decorations. The key takeaway for these subtitles is that the duties and responsibilities of each Military Service’s top civilian and senior military leadership are outlined; this includes the roles they all have in military cyberspace operations.
    - Subtitle E – Reserve Components covers every aspect of the reserve components of the DOD. Some of the topics covered are promotions and authorized manning strength.
    
    **Title 15 - Commerce & Trade**
    
    - Title 15 U.S.C. is about Commerce and Trade. Title 15 U.S.C., as it relates to cyber, covers National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the cybersecurity responsibilities and cybersecurity programs it runs.
    - NIST is a non-regulatory federal agency within the Department of Commerce that serves as a science, engineering, technology, and measurement laboratory.
    
    **Computer Standards Program**
    
    - Through the computer standards program, the NIST has the following missions:
        - Developing standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for information systems.
        - Developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency other than national security systems.
        - Through the Computer Security Division, developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems.
    
    **Research program on security of computer systems**
    
    - This NIST program aids institutions of higher education that enter into partnerships with for-profit entities to support research to improve the security of computer systems.
    - The partnerships may also include government laboratories and nonprofit research institutions.
    
    **Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan**
    
    - Governed by Title 15 U.S.C., Chapter 100A, under Subchapter I – Cybersecurity Research and Development, section (§)7431(a)(1), the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan, is based on an assessment of cybersecurity risk to guide the overall direction of federal cybersecurity and information assurance research and development for information technology (IT) and networking systems.
    - This strategic plan is a collaboration between heads of applicable agencies and departments, through the National Science and Technology Council and the Networking and IT Research and Development Program.
    - The strategic plan is updated every four years and outlines the strategic plan to meet objectives in cybersecurity.
    
    **Title 17 - Copyrights**
    
    - Title 17, U.S.C. is about copyrights. Copyrights protect original works of authorship, in any tangible medium, from reproduction either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
        - It does not, however, cover trademarks.
    - This Title 17 has 13 chapters and sections number from 101 to 1332.
    
    All administrative functions and duties under Title 17 are the responsibility of the Register of Copyrights as director of the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. The Register of Copyrights, together with the subordinate officers and employees of the Copyright Office, are appointed by the Librarian of Congress, and act under the Librarian's general direction and supervision.

    - The Register of Copyrights must make an annual report to the Librarian of Congress of the work and accomplishments of the Copyright Office during the previous fiscal year. The annual report of the Register of Copyrights shall be published separately and as a part of the annual report of the Librarian of Congress.
    
    **Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure**
    
    - Title 18, U.S.C.’s key focus is enforcement of law within the United States.
    - Title 18, U.S.C. permits a broad range of activities that would be considered part of DOD’s broad effort to defend the DODIN, to include blocking Internet protocol (IP) addresses and certain file attachments.
    - Title 18’s role in cyberspace is crime prevention, apprehension, and prosecution of criminals operating in cyberspace.
    - Some of the cyberspace applicable sections of Title 18 are computer fraud, wire fraud, communications lines, Federal Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, and pen registers and trap and trace device.
    
    **Computer fraud §1030**
    
    - The computer fraud section addresses the unauthorized access (or exceeding authorized access) to any protected computer to obtain something of value, causes damage, or loss.
    - Also covered under this statute is the use of ransomware and transmission of a program, code, or command without authorization.
    
    **Wire fraud §1343**

    - It can include fraud by wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce.
        - If found guilty, the member will be fined or imprisoned for not more than twenty years, or both.
        - If the member causes a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency or the fraud affects a financial institution, the person will be fined not more than one million dollars or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.
    
    **Communications lines §1362**
    
    - Communications lines, §1362 deals with destroying or interfering with communications lines, stations, or systems that are owned, operated, or controlled by the United States for military or civil defense functions.
    - Section 1362 is used to prosecute those launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the military or otherwise disrupting military computer network communications.
    
    **The Federal Wiretap Act**
    
    - The Federal Wiretap Act, §2510-2522 prohibits a third party to a communication from wiretapping, monitoring, or intercepting that communication in transit.
    - The Wiretap Act covers both telephone conversations and electronic communications, and it grants protection to individuals above that in the Fourth Amendment (searches and/or seizures with a warrant).
    - However, there are numerous exceptions to the Wiretap Act prohibitions:
        1. Service provider exception §2511(2)(a)(i).
        2. 2. Consent §2511(2)(c)(d).
        3. 3. Pursuant to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act §2511(2)(e).
        4. 4. Communication readily accessible to the general public §2511(2)(g)(i).
        5. 5. Trespasser exception §2511(2)(i).
        6. 6. Inadvertently obtained criminal evidence §2511(3)(b)(iv).
    
    1.  The service provider exception §2511(2)(a)(i) permits service providers to intercept, disclose, or use communications while engaged in activity necessary to provision service or protect the provider’s rights or property.
    
    2.  The consent exception is a two-part exception: the first exception §2511(2)(c) is for a person acting under a law enforcement entity, and the second exception §2511(2)(d) is for a person not acting under a law enforcement entity. 
    
    - The consent exception §2511(2)(c) states it is lawful for a person acting as a law enforcement entity to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception. The consent exception §2511(2)(d) states it is lawful for a person not acting as a law enforcement entity to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal act in violation of the Constitution, state, or federal laws.
    
    3.  The Pursuant to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act exception §2511(2)(e) states that it is lawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic surveillance as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.
    
    4.  The communication readily accessible to the general public exception §2511(2)(g)(i) states that it is lawful to intercept or access an electronic communication that is configured to be readily accessible to the general public.
    
    5.  The trespasser exception §2511(2)(i) states that it is lawful for a person acting under law to intercept the wire or electronic communication of a computer trespassers transmitted to, through, or from a protected computer.
    
    6.  Inadvertently obtained criminal evidence exception §2511(3)(b)(iv) states that a person or entity providing electronic communication service to the public may divulge the contents of inadvertent obtained communication to a law enforcement agency if it appears that a crime was committed.
    
    We will now look at the Stored Communications Act which is also a section within Title 18.
    
    **Stored Communications Act**
    
    - The Stored Communications Act §2701–2712 sets forth a system of statutory privacy rights for customers and subscribers of computer network service providers. There are three main substantive components to this system which serves to protect and regulate the privacy interests of network users with respect to government, network service providers, and the world at large:
    
    1. Section 2701 prohibits unlawful access to certain stored communications; anyone who obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to those communications is subject to criminal penalties.2. Section 2702 regulates voluntary disclosure by network service providers of customer communications and records, both to government and non-government entities.3. Section 2703 creates a code of procedure that federal and state law enforcement officers must follow to compel disclosure of stored communications from network service providers.
    
    - To protect the array of privacy interests identified by its drafters, the Stored Communications Act offers varying degrees of legal protection depending on the perceived importance of the privacy interest involved. Some information can be obtained from providers with a subpoena; other information requires a special court order; and still other information requires a search warrant. In addition, some types of legal process require notice to the subscriber, while other types do not. The Stored Communications Act applies to providers of “electronic communication service” and “remote computing service.”
    - According to §2510(15), an electronic communication service is any service which provides users the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications. Examples of electronic communication service providers are cell phone companies and Yahoo.
    - Remote computing service is defined by §2711(2) as the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.
    
    **Pen registers and Trap/Trace**
    
    - Unless authorized under this law, it is unlawful for anyone to install or use a pen register or trap and trace device without first obtaining a court order.
    - The term “pen register” means a device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted.
        - However, such information must not include the contents of any communication.
    - The term “trap and trace device” means a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information which is likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.
    - However, such information must not include the contents of any communication.
        - Because Internet headers contain both "to" and "from" information, a device that reads the entire header (minus the subject line in the case of email headers) is both a pen register and a trap and trace device, and it is commonly referred to as a pen/trap device per 18 U.S.C. §3127(4).
    - A government agency authorized to install and use a pen register or trap and trace device must use technology reasonably available to it that restricts the recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to the dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information used in the processing and transmitting of wire or electronic communication so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic communications.
    
    **Title 32 - National Guard**
    
    - Title 32, U.S.C. describes the role of the National Guard.
    - Title 32 outlines the organization, personnel, training, service, supply and procurement, as well as homeland defense activities.
    - When in Title 32 status, National Guard forces remain under the operational, tactical, and administrative control of the Governor.
    - This authority is reposed in the Governor, as Commander in Chief, and executed by the Adjutant General, as the state’s senior military commander.
    - If the National Guard is activated for federal service, the Guard is then integrated into Title 10.
    
    **Title 50 - War and National Defense**
    
    - Title 50 U.S.C. governs the conduct of war, national security, and defense related activities.
    - Title 50, in particular, includes provisions related to intelligence activities which specifically assign to the NSA the responsibility to conduct signals intelligence (SIGINT).
        - For example, Title 50 U.S.C. §401, National Security, establishes Air Force intelligence as a member of the intelligence community (IC). It also incorporates EO 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, as it lays out what the elements of the IC are authorized to do in order to conduct intelligence activities.
        - There must be a need, a purpose, collection techniques, attorney general approval, assistance from law enforcement and other civil authorities. EO 12333 also defines foreign intelligence and counterintelligence responsibility of the Services and intelligence oversight.
    - The Twenty-Fifth Air Force (25 AF) has responsibilities under Title 50 through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), undersecretary of defense for intelligence (USD [I]) and the Headquarters Air Force/A2 as part of the general intelligence community and NSA unified organization for the conduct of signals intelligence, and through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
    - The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Act of 2004 requires there to be a civil liberties protection officer within the ODNI 50 U.S.C. §403–3d.
    - The civil liberties protections officer reports directly to the ODNI and is responsible for ensuring that privacy and civil liberties protections are incorporated into the ODNI’s policies and procedures, reviewing any alleged abuses of privacy and civil liberties and conducting privacy impact assessments.
    
    **Do not confuse personnel status with mission authority.** 
    
    - For example, service members in Title 10 status may engage in Title 50 military operations using authorities derived from law and policy.
    - Always determine if the unit is performing an intelligence mission and, if so, whether the organization is authorized to conduct such an activity.
    - Additionally, status of their personnel should be checked to determine mission eligibility and the mission authority to determine the lawfulness of their personnel’s actions.
- **Military Law**
    
    **Uniform Code of Military Justice**
    
    - The UCMJ’s location in U.S.C. is Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 47.
        - Chapter 47 has 12 subchapters and has sections ranging from 801 to 946.
    - As members of the Armed Forces, we know Chapter 47 of the U.S.C. as the UCMJ. Chapter 47 is broken down by articles; hence, we have the Articles of the UCMJ.
    - As is well-known, the UCMJ serves as the basis for holding military members accountable for breaches in binding instruction and law.
    - One such binding area is known as rules of engagement (ROE).
        - ROEs are directives issued by competent military authorities, which delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States Armed Forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered.
        - The key here is “directives issued by competent military authorities*.*” General officers with approval from the National Command Authority will develop these directives. Subordinate commanders are then responsible for ensuring their units comply with these directives. Individual violations of these directives violate numerous articles of the UCMJ and depending on the degree and circumstances may be tried as “War Crimes” under U.S.C. Title 18 – Crimes and Criminal Procedure.
    
    We will discuss just some of the UCMJ articles that cyberspace operators must be familiar with and take care to follow while performing everyday duties, especially while conducting cyberspace operations. The first Article we will discuss is Article 2, Persons subject to the UCMJ.
    
    Article 2, Persons subject to the UCMJ
    
    Below are members who are subject to the UCMJ:
    
    - Members of a regular component of the armed forces, including those awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; volunteers from the time of their muster or acceptance into the armed forces; inductees from the time of their actual induction into the armed forces; and other persons lawfully called or ordered into, or to duty in or for training in, the armed forces, from the dates when they are required by the terms of the call or order to obey it.
    - Cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen.
    - Members of a reserve component while on inactive-duty training, but in the case of members of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States only when in federal service.
    - Retired members of a regular component of the armed forces who are entitled to pay.
    - Retired members of a reserve component who are receiving hospitalization from an armed force.
    - Members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.
    - Persons in custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial.
    - Members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public Health Service, and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with the armed forces.
    - Prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces.
    - In time of declared war or a contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.
    - Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
    - Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons within an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the United States which is under the control of the secretary concerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
    - Individuals belonging to one of the eight categories enumerated in Article 4 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949, who violate the law of war.
    
    **Article 92, Failure to obey order or regulation**
    
    Any person subject to the UCMJ who violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation, having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces, which it is his or her duty to obey, fails to obey the order or is derelict in the performance of his or her duties.
    
    **Article 104, Aiding the enemy**
    
    A member who aids, or attempts to aid, the enemy with arms, ammunition, supplies, money, intelligence, or other things; or who, without proper authority, knowingly harbors or protects or gives intelligence to or communicates or corresponds with or holds any intercourse with the enemy, either directly or indirectly, violates this article and may be punished by death.
    
    **Article 106, Spies**
    
    Any person who in time of war is found lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft, within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States, or elsewhere, will be tried by a general court-martial or by a military commission and on conviction will be punished by death.
    
    **Article 106a, Espionage**
    
    Any person subject to the UCMJ who, with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation, communicates, delivers, or transmits, or attempts to communicate, deliver, or transmit, information to any foreign government, recognized or unrecognized faction or military force, or representative of such government will be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.
    
    **Article 112, Drunk on duty**
    
    Any person subject to the UCMJ other than a sentinel or lookout, who is found drunk on duty, will be punished as a court-martial may direct.
    
    **All articles of the UCMJ**
    
    All articles cannot be described in detail in this course; therefore, please visit http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm for the full list of U.S.C. sections and their corresponding UCMJ articles and offenses.
    
    **Law of Armed Conflict**
    
    The LOAC, as defined by the DOD, is that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The LOAC arises from civilized nations’ humanitarian desire to lessen the effects of conflicts. LOAC protects combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering and safeguards the basic rights of all civilians, any prisoners of war, the wounded, and the sick. The law also tries to keep conflicts from degenerating into savagery and brutality, thereby helping to restore peace.
    
    **LOAC policy**Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 2311.01E, *Department of Defense Law of War Program*, requires each military department to design a program that ensures LOAC observance, prevents violations, ensures prompt reporting of alleged violations, appropriately trains all forces, and completes a legal review of new weapons.
    
    LOAC training is a treaty obligation of the United States under provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. AFI 51–401, *Training and Reporting to Ensure Compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict*, requires that all Air Force personnel receive instruction on the principles and rules of the LOAC commensurate with each member’s duties and responsibilities. The training is of a general nature; however, certain groups such as aircrews, medical personnel, and security forces receive additional, specialized training to address the unique situations they may encounter.
    
    **International and domestic law**LOAC is embodied in both customary international law and treaties. Customary international law establishes many of the oldest rules that govern the conduct of military operations in armed conflict. Article VI of the US Constitution states that treaty obligations of the United States are the “supreme law of the land,” and the United States Supreme Court has held that US international legal obligations, to include custom, is part of US law. This means that treaties and international agreements with the United States enjoy equal status to laws passed by Congress and signed by the president. Therefore, all persons subject to US law must observe the United States’ LOAC obligations. Military personnel, civilians, and contractors authorized to accompany the armed forces in combat must consider the LOAC to plan and execute operations and must obey LOAC in combat. Those who commit violations may be criminally liable for war crimes and court-martialed under the UCMJ.
    
    **LOAC Principles**
    
    Five important LOAC principles govern armed conflict: military necessity, distinction, proportionality, humanity, and chivalry.
    
    **Military necessity**Military necessity permits the application of only that degree of regulated force, not otherwise prohibited by the laws of war, required for the partial or complete submission of the enemy with the least expenditure of life, time, and physical resources.
    
    Attacks must be limited to military objectives; for example, any objects that by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Examples include enemy troops, bases, supplies, lines of communications, and headquarters.
    
    Military necessity does not authorize all military action and destruction. Under no circumstances may military necessity authorize actions specifically prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of war, ill treatment of prisoners of war or internees, the taking of hostages, or execution or reprisal against a person or object specifically protected from reprisal.
    
    **Distinction**Distinction imposes a requirement to distinguish (also termed "discriminate") between the civilian population (or individual civilians not taking a direct part in the hostilities) and combatant forces when engaged in military operations. Military force may be directed only against military objects or objectives, and not against civilian objects.
    
    Civilian objects are protected from attack and include such objects as places of worship, schools, hospitals, and dwellings.
    
    Civilian objects can lose their protected status if they are used to make an effective contribution to military action. In case of doubt whether a civilian object is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, the presumption should be that it is not used for military purposes.
    
    A defender has an obligation to separate civilians and civilian objects (either in the defender’s country or in an occupied area) from military targets. Employment of voluntary or involuntary human shields to protect military objectives or individual military units or personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of war principle of distinction and may lead to a loss of their protected status.
    
    **Proportionality**Those who plan military operations must take into consideration the extent of civilian destruction and probable casualties that will result and seek to avoid or minimize such casualties and destruction to the extent consistent with the necessities of the military situation. Civilian losses must be proportionate to the military advantages sought. The concept does not apply to military facilities and forces, which are legitimate targets anywhere and anytime.
    
    Damages and casualties must be consistent with mission accomplishment and allowable risk to the attacking force (e.g., the attacker need not expose its forces to extraordinary risks simply to avoid or minimize civilian losses).
    
    **Humanity**Humanity is also referred to as the principle of unnecessary suffering. It prohibits the employment of any kind or degree of force not necessary for the purposes of war (such as for the partial or complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of life, time, and physical resources). For example, the 1907 Hague Convention prohibits the use of poison or poisoned weapons in combat. Expanding hollow-point bullets and indiscriminate chemical, biological, and bacterial weapons are banned by treaties because they cause unnecessary suffering. However, using rifles to shoot prisoners of war, strafing civilians, firing on shipwrecked mariners or downed aircrews are lawful weapons that may be used unlawfully.
    
    **Chivalry**Chivalry addresses the waging of war according to well-recognized formalities and courtesies. It permits lawful ruses, such as camouflage, false radio signals, and mock troop movements.
    
    Chivalry forbids treacherous acts to injure the enemy. These involve misuse of internationally recognized symbols (i.e., white flag symbolizing truce) or status to take unfair advantage of the enemy, such as false surrenders, placing anti-aircraft artillery in hospitals, and misuse of the red cross, red diamond, or the red crescent.
    
    **ROEs**
    
    ROEs are directives issued by competent military authorities, which delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States Armed Forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered.
    
    ROE are Our Rules – how we want to operate. These differ from LOAC rules which we will discuss later.
    
    ROE Purposes
    
    - To provide standing guidance during “peacetime”
    - To control the transition from “peacetime” to “conflict”
    - To control combat operations during conflicts
    
- **Executive Orders**
    
    **What are executive orders?**
    
    - An executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.
    - They are numbered consecutively, so executive orders may be referenced by their assigned number, or their topic.
    - Other presidential documents are sometimes similar to executive orders in their format, formality, and issue, but have different purposes.
    - Proclamations, which are also signed and numbered consecutively, communicate information on holidays, commemorations, federal observances, and trade.
    - Administrative orders—e.g. memos, notices, letters, messages—are not numbered, but are still signed, and are used to manage administrative matters of the federal government.
    - All three types of presidential documents—executive orders, proclamations, and certain administrative orders—are published in the *Federal Register,* the daily journal of the federal government that is published to inform the public about federal regulations and actions.
    
    **Example of an executive order**
    
    - EOs can be as simple as updating the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart award (EO 13758),
    - or as complex as planning for federal sustainability in the next decade (EO 13693).
    - A good example of a cybersecurity related order is EO 13691.
        - This EO was signed by former President Barack Obama on 13 February 2015. It is titled “Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing.”
        - The purpose of this EO is to encourage organizations to voluntarily partner with the federal Government to share information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents.
        - This order built upon the foundation established by EO 13636 (Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity) and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 21, *Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience*.
    
    **Executive order modifications**
    
    Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.
    
    5. Intellectual Property and International Communication Laws
    
    As a cyberspace operator charged with safeguarding the network and securing enclaves, you need to know enough about intellectual property (IP) and international communication laws to know it when you see it and determine whether violations are occurring. We will now  give you an overview of the types of IP laws and international communication laws that exist.
    
    As mentioned before, to protect yourself from conducting illegal activities using your personal communication devices and home network, it is suggested that you conduct your own research as this lesson will not make you a law school graduate.
    
- **Intellectual property**
    
    Intellectual property is an intangible property (an asset with value) resulting from human intellect, which can be protected by law. The types of protection for intellectual property are copyright laws, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. We will look at copyright laws first.
    
    **Copyrights**
    
    A copyright is the exclusive right granted under U.S.C. Title 17 to the owner of an original work to reproduce and to distribute copies or phone records, to make derivative works, and to perform or display certain types of the works publicly. Copyright protects expressions like books, movies, music, and so forth. A copyright does not protect ideas. Protections start the moment an expressive work is fixed in writing or on video.
    
    The purpose of a copyright was to encourage creative thinking by preventing others from financially gaining from an original work that they did not come up with on their own. By protecting the rights of the originator, it promotes artists to come up with new ideas without fear of someone else taking their idea and financially gaining from it.
    
    **Duration of a copyright**
    
    There are many types of works that can receive copyright protection. A general copyright lasts the life of the author and 70 years after death. A joint work copyright lasts the life of the last surviving author and 70 years after his or her death. For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the copyright lasts for 95 years from the year it was published or 120 years from the year the work was created, whichever expires first.
    
    **United States Copyright Office**
    
    The United States Copyright Office is responsible for administering a complex and dynamic set of laws, which include registration, the recordation of titles and licenses, a number of statutory licensing provisions, and other aspects of the 1976 Copyright Act and the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. By statute, the Register of Copyrights is the principal advisor to Congress on national and international copyright matters, testifying upon request and providing ongoing leadership and impartial expertise on copyright law and policy.
    
    The Copyright Office works regularly with the Department of Justice, Department of State (DOS), Office of the United States Trade Representative, Department of Commerce, including the Patent and Trademark Office, and the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator.
    
    **Protecting against copyright infringement litigation**
    
    Exercising any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner without the permission of the copyright owner, or without a recognized statutory exception, is copyright infringement. Examples of acts that are copyright infringements are reproducing, distributing, publicly displaying, or publicly performing works that are copyright protected. Even if you do not directly infringe any of the exclusive rights in copyright, you may be guilty of indirect copyright infringement as either a “contributory infringer” or a “vicarious infringer” if you help somebody else infringe.
    
    Contributory infringement results when somebody knows of the direct infringement of another and substantially participates in that infringement, such as inducing, causing, or materially contributing to the infringing conduct. That substantial participation could take the form of providing a device or service that facilitates the infringement if that device or service has no substantial use other than infringement.
    
    Vicarious infringement results when there has been a direct infringement and the vicarious infringer is in a position to control the direct infringer and benefits financially from the infringement.
    
    Permitting the transmission or storage of infringed works on Air Force networks could subject the Air Force to liability as a contributory infringer and subject the member involved to similar lawsuits.
    
    **Trademarks**
    
    A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or device that is used in trade with goods to indicate the source of the goods and to distinguish them from the goods of others. A service mark is the same as a trademark except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. The terms “trademark” and “mark” are commonly used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.
    
    Trademark rights may be used to prevent others from using a similar mark, but not to prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly different mark. Trademarks that are used in interstate or foreign commerce may be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
    
    **Patents**
    
    Patents are used to protect inventions. A patent is the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling an invention. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. US patent grants are effective only within the United States to include territories and possessions. If an inventor wishes to patent an invention in other countries, the member must apply for a patent in each of the other countries or in regional patent offices. Almost every country has its own patent law, and a person desiring a patent in a particular country must complete an application for patent in that country, according to the requirements of that country.
    
    **Types of patents**
    
    There are three types of patents, utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. Utility patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. Design patents may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. Plant patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.
    
    **Patent laws**
    
    The Constitution of the United States gives Congress the power to enact laws relating to patents, in Article I, section 8, which reads "Congress shall have power…to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries." Under this power, Congress has from time to time enacted various laws relating to patents. The first patent law was enacted in 1790. The patent laws underwent a general revision which was enacted 19 July 1952, and which came into effect 1 January 1953. It is codified in Title 35, U.S.C – Patents. Additionally, on 29 November 1999, Congress enacted the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999, which further revised the patent laws.
    
    **Infringement of patents**
    
    Infringement of a patent consists of the unauthorized making, using, offering for sale, or selling any patented invention within the United States or US territories, or importing into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent. If a patent is infringed, the patentee may sue for relief in the appropriate federal court. The patentee may ask the court for an injunction to prevent the continuation of the infringement and may also ask the court for an award of damages because of the infringement. In such an infringement suit, the defendant may raise the question of the validity of the patent, which is then decided by the court. The defendant may also state that what was done does not constitute infringement. Infringement is determined primarily by the language of the claims of the patent and, if what the defendant is making does not fall within the language of any of the claims of the patent, there is no literal infringement.
    
    You will now look at Trade Secrets and how they relate to intellectual property.
    
    **Trade Secrets**
    
    Trade secrets consist of information such as a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process. To meet the most common definition of a trade secret, it must be used in business and give an opportunity to obtain an economic advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.
    
    Courts can protect trade secrets by enjoining misappropriation, ordering parties that have misappropriated a trade secret to take steps to maintain its secrecy, as well as ordering payment of a royalty to the owner. Courts can also award damages, court costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees. This protection is very limited because a trade secret holder is only protected from unauthorized disclosure and use, which is referred to as misappropriation. If a trade secret holder fails to maintain secrecy or if the information is independently discovered, becomes released, or otherwise becomes generally known, protection as a trade secret is lost. Trade secrets do not expire so protection continues until discovery or loss.
    
    The Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 amended U.S.C. Title 18, Chapter 90 – Protection of Trade Secrets. The bill amended the federal criminal code to create a private civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation and increased maximum penalty to trade secret theft. The bill became public law on 11 May 2016.
    
    Next, we will look at International Laws that affect cyberspace operations.
    
- **International Laws Affecting Cyberspace Operations**
    
    **Treaties**
    
    - Most international laws are made up of treaties.
        - Treaties are nothing more than voluntary agreements between two or more countries.
        - By signing a treaty, nations agree to limit their actions in the areas specified by the treaty.
        - Nations entering into treaties may agree to allow some sort of monitoring to ensure that they are complying with the treaty.
    - Why would a nation voluntarily agree to limit itself in any area with a treaty? The primary reason is because nations recognize that it is often in their best interest to cooperate with other nations; failure to do so means potentially excluding itself from the international community, which can affect commerce.
    - A treaty can be created anytime two or more countries come to an agreement to take (or refrain from taking) actions outlined in the treaty.
    - The Convention on Cybercrime was conducted in Budapest, Hungary and hosted by the Council of Europe on 23 November 2001. T
        - he reason for the convention was to setup common criminal law standards aimed at protecting the society against cybercrime by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation.
        - The Convention on Cybercrime was the first international treaty on crimes committed via the Internet and other computer networks, dealing particularly with infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud, and violations of network security. T
        - he treaty includes a list of crimes that each signatory state must create legislation to make certain activities unlawful.
    - Although the United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, the Convention on Cybercrime treaty was signed on 23 November 2001, ratified on 29 September 2006, and entered into force on 1 January 2007.
        - The majority of the articles in the treaty requests each state to create its own laws for cybercrimes; charter 3 (article 23 through article 35) asks for international cooperation between all nations that signed the treaty without reservations.
        - This can be considered as international law.
        - Article 24 discusses extradition for members who commit certain cybercrimes.
        - Article 25 discusses mutual assistance on investigations of certain cybercrimes.
        - Article 29 discusses preservation of stored computer data for cybercrime investigation purposes.
        - Article 35 discusses having each party provide dedicated points of contact who can provide urgent assistance with significant investigations involving electronic evidence.
- **Cyberspace agreements**
    - At the 2014 NATO Wales Summit, consensus was reached affirming that international law applies to state behavior in cyberspace and that cyberspace defense is part of NATO’s collective defense mission.
    - At the 2015 G-20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, one topic that was discussed was international norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. G-20 leaders acknowledged the risk of cyberspace threats to the collective ability to use the Internet to bolster economic growth and development.
    - All leaders agreed that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace and leaders committed that their state would abide by norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, each state agreed that no country should conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.
    
    **Cyberspace Policy and Ethics**
    
    - One responsibility that the SecDef has is to provide policy guidance for the employment of assigned, attached, and supporting military forces conducting cyberspace operations.
        - The policies that are set at DOD level are echoed down through each department. This section will discuss Air Force cyberspace policies.
    - Each branch of the military has its own cyber-related policies. Each branch’s policies and directives must align with DOD instructions (DODI) and DODD.
    
    ***“American’s Air Force: A Call to the Future”***
    
    - In July 2014, former Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Deborah L. James and former Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) Mark A. Welsh III released a 30-year strategic path document titled “American’s Air Force: A Call to the Future.”
        - The purpose of the document was to prepare the Air Force for the path ahead to ensure continued effective and responsive Global Vigilance–Global Reach–Global Power for the nation well into the future.
    - The document outlined five strategic vectors that help the Air Force make the best decisions on investments, institutional changes, and operational concepts into the middle of the 21st century.
        - The five strategic vectors are as follows:
        1. Provide effective 21st century deterrence.
        2. Maintain a robust and flexible global integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability.
        3. Ensure a full-spectrum capable, high end focused force.
        4. Pursue a multi-domain approach to our five core missions.
        5. Continue the pursuit of game-changing technologies.
    
    > “American’s Air Force: A Call to the Future” is the roadmap for all future policy decisions for years to come.
    > 
    
    **Strategic Master Plan**
    
    - In May 2015, the Air Force published the “USAF Strategic Master Plan.”
    - The Strategic Master Plan (SMP) operationalized the “American’s Air Force: A Call to the Future” by providing authoritative direction that informed Air Force wide planning and prioritization on a 20-year timeline.
    - The SMP aligned long-range Air Force strategy, policy, and guidance with planning and programmatic decisions of senior Air Force leadership in support of National Defense and Combatant Command requirement.
        - The SMP has four annexes:
        1.  Human Capital
        2. Strategic Posture
        3. Capabilities
        4. Science and Technology. 
    - Each annex focuses on a foundational element of the Air Force strategy, which relates broadly to people, places, things, and the future.
        - The annexes translate the SMP’s comprehensive goals and objectives into tangible actions and priorities.
    
    **Information Dominance Policy**
    
    - Information dominance is defined as the operational advantage gained from the ability to collect, control, exploit, and defend the information environment to optimize decision making and maximize warfighting effects.
    - Every Air Force mission depends upon information dominance.
        - Because of this fact, it is Air Force policy that information dominance be achieved by fully exploiting the man-made domain of cyberspace to execute, enhance, and support Air Force core missions.
    - In February 2017, the Air Force published the Air Force Information Dominance Flight Plan (IDFP);
        - one of its many purposes is to serve as a unified approach to assuring Air Force core missions.
        - The IDFP provides overarching guidance and processes for unifying cyberspace initiatives through 2027.
        - The IDFP’s primary audience included HAF; Air Force MAJCOMs; lead-commands; core function leads; program executive offices; and any critical stakeholders responsible for acquisitions, planning, programming, and budgeting for future Air Force cyberspace initiatives.
- **Cyber Ethics**
    
    **What is Cyber Ethics?**
    
    - This course will use this definition: “Cyber ethics is a code of responsible behavior on the Internet.”
    
    **Computer Ethics**
    
    The Computer Ethics Institute created what it calls the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics. These commandments have been accepted by the computer and Internet community as a whole. Each commandment starts with “Thou Shalt” and then mentions the unethical acts below:
    
    1. *Not* use a computer to harm other people.
    2. *Not* interfere with other people’s computer work.
    3. *Not* snoop around in other people’s computer files.
    4. *Not* use a computer to steal.
    5. *Not* use a computer to bear false witness.
    6. *Not* copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid.
    7. *Not* use other people’s computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
    8. *Not* appropriate other people’s intellectual output.
    9. Think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
    10. Always use a computer in ways that insure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.
    
    E**thical hacking**
    
    - An ethical hacker is one who attacks a computer system or network in an attempt to gain information and access in the same way a real hacker would attempt.
    - Ethical hackers, also called white hat hackers, are normally independent of the organizations hiring them.
        - They have no ties to their customers so that what they do is completely free of any bias.
        - White hat hackers are dedicated to testing for flaws or vulnerabilities and reporting them through the proper channels to be fixed.
    
    **Unethical Hacking**
    
    - Unethical hackers, also called black hat hackers, conduct many unethical acts when they hack.
        - Some black hat hackers do it for fun, some do it for profit, and some do it to destroy or steal data.
    - Gray hat hackers are somewhere between a white hat hacker and black hat hacker.
    - Gray hat hackers take it upon themselves to hack into networks without the owner’s permission (which is unethical), but they do not hack to hurt, steal, or destroy.
        - In some cases, gray hat hackers let the network or computer owner know about the flaws so the owner can fix them just as a white hat hacker would.
        - In other cases, the gray hat hacker announces the flaws publicly without letting the owner know. This opens the door for black hat hackers; the outcome of that could be disastrous.
    
    **Security tools**
    
    - Port scanning is the most basic technique, aside from social engineering, used to get technical information on a target system.
    - Attackers can determine what operating systems are running, the IP address, what services and versions are available, the open ports, and other valuable information.
    - The information gathered by scanning can be used to target the way into the network.
    - Is scanning ethical? The problems stem from the fact that when someone is scanning a network that they have no rights to, such as a hotel network, an Internet Service Provider, a university, or some similar network, the information gained could be used maliciously.
    - Anytime you scan a network, make sure you have permission in writing, that way there is no question.
    - Using tools to scan and enumerate a network without permission is unethical and can be considered trespassing.
    
    **System Monitoring**
    
    - The argument over port scanning can also be applied to system monitoring. Monitoring an individual system, multiple systems, or even a network segment will provide significant amounts of information based on the amount of activity on what is being monitored.
    - The information gathered by monitoring can provide usage history and activity, usernames and passwords, or even personally identifiable information (PII) which could be used maliciously.
    - Is monitoring ethical? Monitoring in and of itself does no harm, but someone monitoring systems or networks that they do not have authority to monitor is unethical and illegal at the worst.
    - The real dilemmas arise when the system administrator is deciding what to do with the information gleaned by legitimate monitoring.
    - System administrators may be charged with monitoring a portion of a network for performance, maintenance, or unauthorized use.
        - Even though those individuals have access to monitoring capabilities, they must still use them in an ethical manner.
    
    **Ethical terms**
    
    The simplest way to determine if a “use” of a system, network, or capability is ethical is to fit it into one of these three categories:
    
    1. **Prohibited use** – adversely reflects on DOD where use interferes with employee or office productivity or where use is to conduct outside commercial activity.
    
    2. **Authorized use** – does not interfere with the performance of official duties, it is of reasonable during or frequency, it serves a legitimate government interest, and it does not reflect adversely on DOD.
    
    3. **Official use** – performance of work associated with your day-to-day responsibilities and performance of only official duties on official time.
    
    - System administrators *authorized to use* monitoring capabilities are required to use those capabilities for official use only.
    - *Official use* only means in performance of official duties associated with assigned day-to-day responsibilities on official time only.
        - Any monitoring conducted outside of that framework would be considered unethical and could result in legal complications for a system administrator even if the monitoring resulted in detecting an unlawful network activity.
    - Monitoring of an individual user’s activity is prohibited unless acting on proper authority, such as in coordination with a law enforcement investigation.
    - Monitoring overall network activity in terms of total bandwidth usage may constitute legitimate monitoring, provided the system administrator is acting within the scope and course of his or her duties.
    
    **Consent to Monitoring**
    
    - Users of the DODIN and/or Air Force Information Network (AFIN) must consent to monitoring before they can be authorized on the networks.
        - If you have ever logged onto an Air Force or DOD computer network, you should be familiar with the DOD Consent to Monitoring banner that pops up on the screen.
        - The policy established departmental guidance on the use of DODIN systems and standardized the wording to be included in user agreements.
        - As a user, you must agree to consent to monitoring or you will be denied access to DODIN or AFIN. Therefore for Air Force networks, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.
    
    **Private entity system monitoring**
    
    U.S.C. Title 6 – Domestic Security §1503a, gives a private entity authorization to prevent, detect, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Additionally, it states that the private entity can monitor:
    
    - Its own information systems;
    - The information system of another non-federal entity upon receiving authorization and written consent from the non-federal entity;
    - The information system of a federal entity upon receiving authorization and written consent from an authorized representative of the federal entity; and
    - The information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an information system that the private entity is authorized to monitor.
- **Privacy Act of 1974**
    
    **Privacy Act of 1974**
    
    - The purpose of the Privacy Act is to balance the government’s need to maintain information about individuals, with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasions of their privacy; stemming from federal agencies’ collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information about them.
    - The historical context of the Act is important to an understanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Congress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance and investigation of individuals by federal agencies that had been exposed during the Watergate scandal.
        - It was also concerned with potential abuses presented by the government’s increasing use of computers to store and retrieve personal data by means of a universal identifier — such as an individual’s social security number.
        
        **The Act focuses on four basic policy objectives:**
        
        1. To restrict disclosure of personally identifiable records maintained by agencies.
        2. To grant individuals increased rights of access to agency records maintained on them.
        3. To grant individuals the right to seek amendment of agency records maintained on themselves upon a showing that the records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
        4. To establish a code of “fair information practices” that requires agencies to comply with statutory norms for collection, maintenance, and dissemination of records
    
    **Privacy Act Terms**
    
    **Individual Defined**
    
    - An “individual” is “a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence [5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(2)] .”
    - According to the Privacy Act, deceased individuals and their next of kin do not have any Privacy Act rights, nor do corporations or organizations.
    - Privacy Act rights are personal to the individual who is the subject of the record and cannot be asserted derivatively by others.
    - However, the parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual.
        - The *Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines* note that parental oversight is “discretionary and that individuals who are minors are authorized to exercise the rights given to them by the Privacy Act or, in the alternative, their parents or those acting in loco parentis may exercise them in their behalf.”
        - The OMB Guidelines also state that there is essentially no absolute right of a parent to have access to a record about a child absent a court order or consent.
    
    **Record Defined**
    
    - A “record” is “any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.”
    - To qualify as a Privacy Act “record,” the information must identify an individual.
    - The OMB Guidelines state that the term “record” means “any item of information about an individual that includes an individual identifier” and “can include as little as one descriptive item about an individual.”
    
    **System of Records**
    
    - A “system of records” is “a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.”
    - The OMB Guidelines explain that a system of records exists if:
        1. There is an “indexing or retrieval capability using identifying particulars [that is] built into the system”;
        2. the agency “does, in fact, retrieve records about individuals by reference to some personal identifier.” 
    - The Guidelines state that the “is retrieved by” criterion “implies that the grouping of records under the control of an agency is accessed by the agency by use of a personal identifier; not merely that a capability or potential for retrieval exists.”
    
    **Personal Information**
    
    **Protecting Personal Information**
    
    - In the Air Force, Guidance related to the protection of Personal Information is covered in AFI 33-332, *Privacy Act Program.*
    - In accordance with the Privacy Act, each agency that maintains a system of records must “maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President.” An individual’s rights are not violated so long as the maintenance of the information at issue is relevant and necessary to accomplish a legal purpose of the agency.
    - The Privacy Act says agencies must “collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.”
        - However, according to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit this does not mean all information must be collected from the individual.
    - The PA requires a reasonable effort by the agency to review records prior to their dissemination.
    - It also prohibits agencies from maintaining records “describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.”
    - Assuming that the challenged record itself describes activity protected by the First Amendment, individual rights are violated unless maintenance of the record is:
    1. Expressly authorized by statute
    2. Expressly authorized by the individual about whom the record is maintained
    3. Pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity
    
    **“No Disclosure Without Consent” Rule**
    
    - Once a government agency has personal information in its possession, there is a general “no disclosure without consent” rule that applies unless the requested information falls under one of 12 exceptions.
    - A “disclosure” can be by any means of communication — written, oral, electronic, or mechanical.  The no disclosure without consent rule states that:

    - A privilege means this kind of information is not normally divulged to law enforcement and may not be used in court.
    - Beyond that, it is important to remember that the kinds of communications that occur between people and their lawyers, or chaplain or psychotherapists are potentially some of the most sensitive personal information one may impart to another person.
