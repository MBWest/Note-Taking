# SSH Keys

If we have read access over the `.ssh` directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the `/root/.ssh/` directory and can read the `id_rsa` file, we can copy it to our machine and use the `-i` flag to log in with it:
  
    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
    MBWest@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa

**Note that we used the command `chmod 600 id_rsa` on the key after we created it on our machine to change the file's permissions to be more restrictive. If ssh keys have lax permissions, i.e., maybe read by other people, the ssh server would prevent them from working.**
