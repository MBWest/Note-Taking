# nslookup 

Query Internet name servers interactively
- Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. `Interactive mode` allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. `Non-interactive` mode is used to print just the name and requested information for a host or domain.
