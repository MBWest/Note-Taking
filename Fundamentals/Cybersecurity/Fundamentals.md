# Cybersecurity - Fundamentals

> ## **CIA Triad**

- `Confidentiality` - Protect data disclosure to those who are only authenticated and authorized. 
    - Encryption, user authentication and authorization, file permissions, access control lists, data classification
- `Integrity` - Protect data from deletion or modification by unauthorized individuals. 
    - Logging and auditing, hashing, version control, data backups and recovery
- `Availability` - Provide system and resource redundancy to ensure data is accessible to authorized users.
    - Redundant hardware, disk arays, multiple network connections, backup and recovery solution

> ## **Defense in Depth**

- A general breakdown of the logical components of a network into categories where secuirty controls can be applied to provide overlapping security and visibility

- Defense in Depth (DiD) provides the oportunity for: Detection, Prevention, Protection, and Recovery
    - Preimeter > Network > Host > Application > Data

> ## **Identity and Access Management**

- Identity and Access Management - is the process of managing uysers, access, permissions and accounting of those events. 
- Commonly referred to as `AAA`
    - `Authentication` - Validate the authenticity and validity of credentials provided and verify if legitimate
    - `Authorization` - Approve or disapprove access based upon authorized credentials assigned access and permissions to systems and data
    - `Accounting` - Log, store and analyze AA events for anomalies and known malicious events

> ## **Zero Trust**
- The principle in managing access in which no users, whether internal or external have blanket access.
- Traditionally, resources were available for users who at a minimum were authorized network users. 
- Zero Trust is granular access that does not truth that just because a user is authenticated that they are also authorized.
- Zero Trust requires strong data classification, logging, accounting, and visibility of network resources, systems and users

> ## **Proactive Security**
- The thoughtful accounting of risk and preparing solutions and countermeasures against associated threats and attack vectors:
    - Continually evaluating security requirements
    - Risk and Threat analysis
    - Security policy that implements standards, goals, and expectations
    - Code reviews and static analysis
    - Fusing threat intelligence into operations
    - Knowledge gap assessments
    - Proactive analysis or "Threat Hunting"
