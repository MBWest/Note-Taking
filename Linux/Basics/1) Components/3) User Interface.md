# Linux Components - User Interface

> ### **User Interface**
- The User Interface (UI) is also known as a shell
    - The shell is how a user interacts with the OS
    - Originally only a Command Line Interface (CLI) was offered
    - Most Linux OSs now offer a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
- The kernel is the core of the OS and interacts with the hardware

```
User↔Shell↔Kernel↔Hardware 
```
