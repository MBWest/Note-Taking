# TTY Spawn Shell

## **Python Spawn Shell**

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

---

## **Fully Interactive TTY**

### **The First Step**

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Which uses Python to spawn a better-featured bash shell. At this point, our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won’t be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys.

### **The Second Step**

```
export TERM=xterm
```

This will give us access to term commands such as clear.

### **The Last Step**

Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using

```
Ctrl + Z
```

Back in our own terminal we use

```
stty raw -echo; fg
```

This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes

```
stty rows 38 columns 116
```
