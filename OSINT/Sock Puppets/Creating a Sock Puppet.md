https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/dp70jr/my_process_for_setting_up_anonymous_sockpuppet/

- This is my process for setting up an anonymous sockpuppet account.

1. Come up with a persona for the sockpuppet account.

2. Use Fake Name Generator[https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/] to create a person whom you feel fits your sockpuppet persona.

3. Use This Person Does Not Exist(https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) to generate an image. Make sure you inspect the image closely and get one that doesn't have any obvious flaws, as they often do. It is worth picking up some Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity Photo or Designer, or other basic image manipulation skills to fix them and change the background of the image.

4. Get a burner phone, completely wiped and fresh. Can be any brand that will accept a Mint Mobile SIM card.

5. Get a burner credit card from Privacy.com(https://privacy.com/) to use for on Amazon and possible the Mint Mobile setup. They might need it to set up the account.

6. Set up a burner Amazon account. We're only going to use it once.

7. Buy two Mint Mobile SIM cards. You can find them various places online and in stores near you, but you can get two of them for $5 on Amazon. They also give you 1 week free trial with something like 100 text messages, which we're going to use. This gives you two cards for two sockpuppet accounts for only $5.

8. I like to use Amazon to have the card sent to an Amazon pickup box, which can be anonymous.

9. Get a VPN that you can set to the physical area in which you want your sockpuppet to "exist."

10. Set up the Mint Mobile trial account somewhere away from your home; as far as you're willing to go.

11. Use this Mint Mobile trial phone number to set up all of the websites you need.

12. I recommend at least set up a Google account and Protonmail account. Both will come in handy at different times.

13. Once you've set up all the accounts with your trial Mint SIM, set up 2FA on all of the accounts.

14. After setting up 2FA on all of the accounts, change the phone number to one you have more permanent access to, such as MySudo or Google Voice.

15. Make sure everything works!

16. Destroy the SIM card.

17. Wipe the phone.
