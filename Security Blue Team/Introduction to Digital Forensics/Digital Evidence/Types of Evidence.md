# Types of Evidence

## What is digital evidence?

It\'s information or data that is related to an investigation, which is stored on, transmitted, or received by an electronic device

## Evidence Via Computers

- Most of the time, evidence will be files and other data on electronic storage media, such as hard-drives in desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.

- Other types of evidence found on standalone computers can include saved emails or saved chat logs, images, text files, videos, audio files, and more.

## Evidence Via Network

- Browser history is a big one, by working as a record book of what sites the user has visited, we can use this to understand what resources have been accessed online, and when. This is beneficial when dealing with events where an employee may be breaching the company’s Acceptable Use Policy by inappropriately browsing the internet during work hours (too much time on social-media, gaming, inappropriate or pornographic sites, illegal sites, working on a personal business whilst at work).

- You don’t need to rely on the browser either – network devices such as a web proxy or router will also hold information about requested sites online, as everything will likely go through these systems.

## Evidence Via Mobile Devices

- Evidence such as call history (incoming/outgoing/number/duration), text messages, contacts, web history, images, videos, apps, GPS location, notes, and much more can be retrieved if appropriate. Deleted files can be restored, old app data can be retrieved, and much more using specialist mobile forensics tools.
