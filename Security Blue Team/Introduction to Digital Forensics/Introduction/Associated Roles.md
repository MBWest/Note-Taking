### Associated Roles

### The below roles generally contain work that includes certain aspects of Digital Forensics:

#### Tier One SOC Analyst (Junior Security Analyst)
Conduct low-level investigations, mainly first-line incident response, and collect evidence which will be added to an investigation case. This evidence is then used as justification for taking defensive measures, such as blocking an IP, domain, or email sender.

#### Digital Forensics Analyst
Digital Forensics Analysts will work on high-profile investigations, escalated cases, employee monitoring, working with the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT), and other tasks that require trusted and highly-technical individuals.

#### Insider Threat Analyst
Security professionals that focus on detecting and monitoring insider threats will utilize their extensive digital forensics skills to ensure that no stone is left unturned, and that any and all evidence against an individual is collected in the appropriate manner.
