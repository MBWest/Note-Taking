### Why is it Useful?

#### Supporting Incident Response Capabilities
When dealing with an incident, it is important to correctly gather and preserve evidence so it can be used for analysis, intelligence sharing, and potentially prosecution.

#### Legal Prosecution (Chain of Custody)
If this evidence is not kept secure, accounted for, and unmodified at all times, it will not be valid and hold no weight in court.

##### A Security Deterrent
Have a strong security team may deter less-sophisticated actors from conducting attacks in the first place.

#### Monitoring Employees
Sometimes employees need to be monitored closely due to suspicious or malicious behaviour. This could include inappropriate internet browsing on work systems, breaches of an Acceptable Use Policy, downloading malicious or inappropriate files, or any other scenario that requires intervention from the security team.
