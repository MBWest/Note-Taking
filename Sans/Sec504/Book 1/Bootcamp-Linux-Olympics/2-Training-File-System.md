File System (1)
The Linux file system uses absolute and relative path references. Absolute paths always start with a '/'.
Change to the /var/tmp/badminton directory using an absolute path.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:~$ cd /var/tmp/badminton

File System (2)
Display the badminton fact in the /var/tmp/badminton directory.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/var/tmp/badminton$ cat badmintonfact1.txt 
    Badminton is an Olympic sport since 1992 with five events

File System (3)
Relative paths can also be used in Linux without a leading '/'.
Change to the ../badminton2 directory using a relative path.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/var/tmp/badminton$ cd ../badminton2

File System (4)
Display the badminton fact in the /var/tmp/badminton2 directory.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/var/tmp/badminton2$ cat badmintonfact2.txt 
    Sixteen feathers are needed to make a shuttlecock. The best shuttles are made
    from the feathers from the left wing of a goose.

File System (5)
Relative paths can use multiple '..' indicators to travel up several directories.
Change to the ../../../tmp directory using a relative path.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/var/tmp/badminton2$ cd ../../../tmp/

File System (6)
Display the badminton fact in the /tmp directory.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ cat badmintonfact3.txt 
    Badminton is the fastest racket sport with shuttle clocking speed in excess of
    200 MPH.

File System (7)
The find command uses the basic syntax 'find [starting directory] -name "wildcard"'.
Use the find command to list all files matching *.txt in /home.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home *.txt
    /home
    /home/olympian
    /home/olympian/HELP
    /home/olympian/.fact
    /home/olympian/.fact/badmintonfact4.txt
    /home/olympian/Documents
    /home/olympian/Documents/Badmintonfact6.Txt
    /home/olympian/.bashrc

    /home/init/bottom_pane
    /home/init/top_pane
    /home/init/questions_answers.json
    badmintonfact3.txt

File System (8)
Repeat the 'find' command, this time displaying all files ending in .TXT in /home.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home *.TXT
    /home
    /home/olympian
    /home/olympian/HELP
    /home/olympian/.fact
    /home/olympian/.fact/badmintonfact4.txt
    /home/olympian/Documents
    /home/olympian/Documents/Badmintonfact6.Txt

    /home/init/bottom_pane
    /home/init/top_pane
    /home/init/questions_answers.json
    find: ‚Äò*.TXT‚Äô: No such file or directory

File System (9)
Repeat the 'find' command, this time displaying all files ending in any case combination of .TXT in /home.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home -iname *.TXT
    /home/olympian/.fact/badmintonfact4.txt
    /home/olympian/Documents/Badmintonfact6.Txt
    /home/jhashman/BADMINTONFACT5.TXT

File System (10)
Repeat the 'find' command, this time displaying all files ending in any case combination of .TXT in /home or in /tmp.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home /tmp -iname *.TXT
    /home/olympian/.fact/badmintonfact4.txt
    /home/olympian/Documents/Badmintonfact6.Txt
    /home/jhashman/BADMINTONFACT5.TXT

    find: ‚Äò/tmp/_MEIayWFsb‚Äô: Permission denied
    /tmp/.badmintonfact7.txt
    find: ‚Äò/tmp/_MEIbVwTgC‚Äô: Permission denied
    /tmp/badmintonfact3.txt

File System (11)
Display the new badminton fact in the /tmp directory.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ cat .badmintonfact7.txt 
    The two most successful badminton countries are China and Indonesia
    which between them have won 70% of all Badminton World Federation events.

File System (12)
The find command can display output similar to the ls command using the -ls argument. Display the file list information for all badminton facts in /home.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home -ls

File System (13)
The find command can also search for files based on size. Identify the badminton fact file in /home that is 72 bytes in size (-size 72c).

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ find /home -size 72c
    /home/snehwal/badmintonfact8.text

File System (14)
Display all of the badminton facts in /var, /tmp, and /home using find's -exec feature and cat.

    olympian@bc-filesystem:/tmp$ cd /
    olympian@bc-filesystem:/$ find /var /tmp /home -iname *badminton* -exec cat '{}' \;
